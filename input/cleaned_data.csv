2023-02-21,Microsoft enters 10-year agreement with Nvidia and Nintendo in fight to save Activision deal,"Microsoft announced it has agreed to partnerships with Nvidia and Nintendo as it tries to convince European Union officials to approve its $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard — the company behind the popular game franchise Call of Duty. Microsoft President Brad Smith had a closed-door meeting Tuesday with EU regulators and competitors in Brussels to address concerns that its acquisition of Activision Blizzard could hurt competition in the video game industry. The deal has also come under scrutiny from regulators in the United States and the United Kingdom. Microsoft         (MSFT) said that it has entered into a 10-year partnership with Nvidia to bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. In a statement, the software giant said the partnership “resolves Nvidia’s concerns with Activision Blizzard. Nvidia therefore is offering its full support for regulatory approval of the acquisition.” Microsoft also revealed it has finalized a 10-year agreement to bring the latest version of “Call of Duty” to the Nintendo platform once the merger with Activision is completed. Smith told CNN’s Richard Quest on Tuesday that “a lot changed today because Microsoft has announced two agreements that together will bring Call of Duty, the game that everyone has been talking about, to 150 million more people on Nintendo devices and Nvidia’s cloud streaming services.” He went on to say these two deals address the concern that Call of Duty will be less available than it is today and will be more available instead due to these two binding agreements. “We’re really down to one principal company that is objecting to this deal, and that’s Sony, and we’ve made clear that we’re happy to enter a 10-year agreement with Sony and we’re prepared to enter regulatory obligations as well, whether it’s London or Brussels or Washington,” Smith said. “So, in addition to a contract, we’d have a duty under the law.”",CNN
2024-02-14,"Nvidia is now worth more than Alphabet, one day after surpassing Amazon","Wall Street’s favorite artificial intelligence darling is continuing to swell to staggering heights. Nvidia’s market capitalization rose to $1.83 trillion on Wednesday, nudging past Alphabet’s $1.82 trillion market cap. Shares of the Santa Clara-based chipmaker rose 2.5% to $739 a share, while Alphabet shares ended the session at $145.94. Earlier this week, Nvidia surpassed Amazon, closing with a higher market cap on Tuesday for the first time since 2002. Nvidia shares have been on a tear since 2023, when investors swept up in AI hype bought up shares of Big Tech stocks, spurring a bull market against a backdrop of sky-high interest rates and leading the S&P 500 index to jump 24% last year. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI mania dominating Wall Street. The stock is up 49% this year after soaring 239% in 2023. Most of the Magnificent Seven, the group of tech stocks that have led the bull market, have continued to race even higher this year with Nvidia leading the pack. But some investors are skeptical that they can match their staggering gains from last year. “The valuation for this company is based on a very rapid growth rate. Anything that could potentially derail that growth rate would have a very negative impact on that valuation,” wrote Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, in a note on Monday. “Investors should proceed with caution.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said it is important to democratize AI technology, and that the AI titan should provide that capability. “There’s a sovereign AI movement that’s happening everywhere. Every country should protect their own data,” Huang told CNN at the World Government Summit in Dubai. “We need to enable every region to create their own digital intelligence.” CNN’s Gayle Harrington contributed to this story.",CNN
2022-03-01,Nvidia says hackers stole employee credentials and company data,"Chipmaker Nvidia         (NVDA) said Tuesday that the cybersecurity breach it has been investigating for almost a week has resulted in the theft of company data. “We are aware that the threat actor took employee credentials and some NVIDIA proprietary information from our systems and has begun leaking it online,” a company spokesperson told CNN in a statement. There is no indication that the attack was an instance of ransomware or that it is connected to the war in Ukraine, the spokesperson added. The company reiterated that it does not expect any disruptions to business operations stemming from the breach, which was first detected Feb. 23. At a market cap of about $600 billion, Nvidia is the most valuable chipmaker in the United States. It is known for its graphics processing units (GPU) that enhance videogaming experiences and advanced computer simulations.",CNN
2024-02-22,A good day for 401(k)s: S&P 500 and Dow hit new highs as Nvidia fervor takes hold of Wall Street,"US stocks soared to new highs on Thursday after Nvidia, the third largest company on Wall Street, blew past earnings expectations and bolstered investor optimism on Wall Street. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both notched new record highs and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was within striking distance of its own all-time high, reached in November 2021. The Dow ended the day 457 points, or 1.2%, higher. The S&P 500 gained 2.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 3% higher. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recorded their best days in over a year and the Dow surpassed the 39,000 level for the first time. Nvidia (NVDA) also reached a new record high, popping 16.4% after reporting extraordinary earnings growth, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. The company gained $277 billion in value on Thursday alone, marking the largest-ever increase in a trading session. Nvidia, a chipmaker whose technology is used to power AI, mentioned the term 67 times before taking any questions during its earnings call Wednesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement on Wednesday evening that generative AI has now “hit the tipping point,” and that he expects more growth ahead. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” he said. The California-based firm has seen its take-home income grow 769% year-over-year and the company’s full-year profits are up more than 580% from the year earlier. Other chipmakers benefited from Nvidia’s good news. Shares of AMD (AMD) were 10.7% higher on Thursday morning and Microsoft (MSFT) was 2.4% higher. Tech stocks also enjoyed a boost. Meta and Amazon were up 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively, and shares of Apple were 1.1% higher. But some companies were left out of the fun: Intel, which laid out its plans to compete with Nvidia during a conference on Wednesday, fell by 1.1%. The Nvidia-led rally has put worries about the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates higher for longer on the backburner for now, but traders got some disappointing news on Wednesday. Fed officials continue to worry that inflation could remain stubbornly elevated during their policy meeting last month, minutes released yesterday afternoon showed. That could keep interest rates at 23-year high for longer than previously expected, affecting Americans’ borrowing costs on everything from car loans to mortgages. Traders now largely expect the Fed to begin cutting rates in June or July, rather than at its May policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.",CNN
2023-10-18,Taiwan’s Foxconn to build ‘AI factories’ with Nvidia,"Taiwan’s Foxconn says it plans to build artificial intelligence (AI) data factories with technology from American chip giant Nvidia, as the electronics maker ramps up efforts to become a major global player in electric car manufacturing. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang jointly announced the plans on Wednesday in Taipei. The duo said the new facilities using Nvidia’s chips and software will enable Foxconn to better utilize AI in its electric vehicles (EV). “We are at the beginning of a new computing revolution,” Huang said. “This is the beginning of a brand new way of doing software — using computers to write software that no humans can.” Large computing systems powered by advanced chips will be able to develop software platforms for the next generation of EVs by learning from everyday interactions, they said. “Foxconn is turning from a manufacturing service company into a platform solution company,” Liu said. “In three short years, Foxconn has displayed a remarkable range of high-end sedan, passenger crossover, SUV, compact pick-up, commercial bus and commercial van.” Best known as the assembler of Apple’s iPhones, Foxconn envisages a similar business model for EVs. It doesn’t sell the vehicles under its own brand. Instead, it will build them for clients in Taiwan and globally. In 2021, Foxconn unveiled three EV models, including two passenger cars and a bus, for the first time. They were followed by additional models last year and two new ones — Model N, a cargo van, and Model B, a compact SUV — during Foxconn’s tech day on Wednesday. Its electric buses started running in the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung last year, while its first electric car, sold under the N7 brand by Taiwanese automaker Luxgen, is expected to begin deliveries on the island from January 2024. Foxconn has entered a competitive industry. Global sales of EVs, including purely battery powered vehicles and hybrids, exceeded 10 million units last year, up 55% from 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. Nearly 14 million electric cars will be sold in 2023, it projected. Foxconn, which is officially known as the Hon Hai Technology Group, has been expanding its business by entering new industries such as EVs, digital health and robotics. Analysts say its entry into the EV space is a “logical diversification.” Smartphones are “a very saturated market already, and the room to grow in the … industry is getting [smaller],” said Kylie Huang, a Taipei-based analyst at Daiwa. “If they can really tap into the EV business, I do think that [they] could become influential in the next couple of years.” During last year’s tech day, Liu told reporters that the company hoped to build 5% of the world’s electric cars by 2025. It aims to eventually produce up to 40% to 45% of EVs around the world. But its foray into the industry hasn’t been entirely smooth. Last year, Foxconn bought a factory from Lordstown Motors in Ohio that used to make small cars for General Motors. That partnership ended in June, with the American car company filing for bankruptcy protection and announcing a lawsuit against Foxconn. Lordstown Motors accused Foxconn of “fraud” and failing to follow through on investment promises, while Foxconn dismissed the suit as “meritless” and criticized the company for making “false comments and malicious attacks.” Still, it’s clear Foxconn is leaning into its expanded ambitions, including hiring two new chief strategy officers for its EV and chips businesses. Chiang Shang-yi is a Taiwanese semiconductor industry veteran who helped TSMC become a global foundry powerhouse, while Jun Seki, a former vice chief operating officer at Nissan Motor, leads the EV unit. In May, Foxconn announced a new partnership with Infineon Technologies, a German company that specializes in automotive semiconductor chips, to establish a new research center in Taiwan. Bill Russo, founder of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automobility, said Foxconn has the advantage of coming from a consumer electronics background, which could allow it to come up with more innovative EV products compared with traditional automakers. “The biggest problem with legacy automakers is that they have so much sunk investment in a carryover platform, that they typically want to start not with a clean sheet of paper, but with a highly constrained set of requirements,” he said. “Those carryover technologies bring constraints to how you think about vehicles.” “When Tesla started, it started by saying, ‘I’m going to challenge all of that, I’m going to blow up the basic architecture of a car and simplify it greatly,’” he added. “I think that’s the advantage that a technology company has … And I think that’s the way Foxconn will come at this.” Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.

2020-04-20,Iowa beef plant reopens one day after coronavirus outbreak,"Iowa Premium National Beef Plant in Tama has resumed operations today, just one day after state health officials said at least 177 of its employees had tested positive for Covid-19 and the governor reported the plant as a ""new outbreak"" location at today's news conference. An employee who answered the phone at the plant Monday afternoon told CNN that ""we are back online as of today, we did a kill today."" The plant originally closed on April 10. CNN has reached out to National Beef for comment but has not heard back. The bigger picture: Several major meat processors across the US are starting to shut down plants as employees are getting infected by coronavirus. Consumers are unlikely to see any shortages because of production disturbances. But the closures are devastating for some meat producers, which have remained open during the pandemic. Food suppliers are essential businesses. The United States has a large enough meat inventory to prevent shortages for consumers, explained Christine McCracken, senior analyst of animal protein for Rabobank. Processors that were previously servicing restaurants or cafes have started to sell to retailers. And some restaurants are selling groceries, including meat, directly to customers.",CNN
2023-05-31,"Fueled by AI, Nvidia joins the $1 trillion club","Booming demand for its AI chips has landed Nvidia         (NVDA) a prime spot in one of the most exclusive clubs on Wall Street: The chipmaker hit a market cap of $1 trillion on Tuesday. It’s just the ninth company globally to have achieved such a feat, and only five other companies worldwide currently have the distinction: Apple         (AAPL), Microsoft         (MSFT), Alphabet         (GOOG), Amazon         (AMZN) and Saudi Aramco. Nvidia took Wall Street by surprise last week when it reported gangbusters earnings and an exceedingly strong revenue forecast for the year ahead. Fueled largely by the recent boom in AI, the report pushed share price higher and secured its position as the one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world. Nvidia makes chips that power generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text and images, in response to user prompts. That’s the kind of AI underlying ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, Dall-E and many of the other new AI technologies. Last quarter, the company’s profit surged 26% to $2 billion, and sales rose 19% to $7.2 billion, each easily surpassing Wall Street analysts’ forecasts. Nvidia’s outlook for the current quarter was also significantly — about 50% — higher than analysts’ predictions. Its stock is up about 180% so far this year. “Nvidia gave jaw-dropping robust guidance that will be heard around the world and shows the historical demand for AI happening now in the enterprise and consumer landscape,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “For any investor calling this an AI bubble (crypto, metaverse, now AI bubble thesis) we would point them to this Nvidia quarter and especially guidance which cements our bullish thesis around AI and speaks to the 4th Industrial Revolution now on the doorstep with AI.” Nvidia shares need to remain above $404.86 to retain a trillion dollar market cap. Shares of the stock are currently trading at $408.50.",CNN
2022-02-08,The biggest chip deal in history has fallen apart,"SoftBank’s record-breaking sale of a prized chip designer to Nvidia has officially been called off. At an initial value of $40 billion, the US chipmaker’s acquisition of British design firm ARM would have been the largest semiconductor deal on record. But regulators around the world have long raised concerns about the deal, eventually leading to its collapse on Tuesday. In a statement, SoftBank cited “significant regulatory challenges” that prevented it from completing the deal. It said that it would instead prepare ARM for a public offering within the fiscal year ending March 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, SoftBank had already received a deposit of $1.25 billion during the signing. That payment was non-refundable, and “will be recognized as profit” in the Japanese conglomerate’s earnings for the quarter ending this March, it said. ARM designs chips used by Apple         (AAPL) and other major smartphone makers. The firm is based in Cambridge and is known as one of Britain’s most successful tech companies. The transaction was first announced in 2020, four years after SoftBank bought ARM for $32 billion, marking the largest foreign takeover by a Japanese firm at the time. It was originally expected to close within 18 months, which would have been around this time. But it ran out of steam as it became a subject of global regulatory scrutiny, including from China and the United Kingdom. Just days after the announcement, an opinion piece in Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times had dubbed the move “disturbing.” “If ARM falls into US hands, Chinese technology companies would certainly be placed at a big disadvantage in the market,” read the op-ed. In December, the US Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, saying it would stifle competition and give the combined company too much control over chip technology and designs. The European Commission also launched an investigation into the deal late last year. The deal would have had to pass regulatory approvals from the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States and China. Had it gone through, it would have been the semiconductor industry’s biggest-ever deal, topping Avago’s acquisition of Broadcom in 2015, according to Dealogic. Speaking at an earnings presentation on Tuesday, SoftBank         (SFTBF) CEO Masayoshi Son remained optimistic about future plans for ARM. While he acknowledged that his company was now pivoting toward a “plan B,” he said that SoftBank had originally hoped to take ARM public after acquiring it years ago. “[So] this is [the] original plan again,” he said. Still, the billionaire hit out at those who had opposed the deal, arguing that critics had appeared “eager to block” a deal between “two totally different businesses.” In the history of antitrust complaints, “this could be the first case” involving claims about two such “different companies,” he said, likening Nvidia and ARM to the makers of car engines and tires. “Why do they have to block this transaction?” he asked. ARM also announced a new leader on Tuesday, saying that longtime CEO Simon Segars would be replaced by executive Rene Haas. In a statement, Son thanked Segars for his 30-year tenure at the company and said that “Rene is the right leader to accelerate ARM’s growth as the company starts making preparations to reenter the public markets.” — Rishi Iyengar contributed to this report.",CNN
2022-05-06,"Nvidia misled investors about impact of crypto mining on its business, SEC alleges","For years, video gamers have blamed shortages of PC graphics cards on cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who have snapped up growing numbers of the devices to generate digital coins. The pandemic, along with the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese imports, have only made the situation worse, leading to skyrocketing retail and aftermarket prices. Now, US securities regulators say the graphics card giant Nvidia knew cryptocurrency miners had been eating into sales of cards meant for gaming — and thus potentially contributing to supply issues — but had illegally withheld that fact from investors who repeatedly asked about crypto mining’s impact on Nvidia’s gaming segment. In a cease-and-desist order on Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Nvidia would pay $5.5 million to settle the allegations of inadequate disclosure, adding in a release that the company’s “omissions of material information … were misleading.” Nvidia declined to comment for this story. The order marks yet another sign of the SEC’s emerging focus on virtual currencies; the agency separately announced this week it is hiring another 20 people to investigate and prosecute cryptocurrency fraud and cybercrime. It also validates concerns that PC gamers have been increasingly forced to compete with the cryptocurrency industry as generating coins such as Ethereum has grown more computationally demanding. The SEC’s allegations zero in on Nvidia’s quarterly reports in fiscal year 2018, when graphics cards began being used to mine virtual currencies. As the value of currencies such as Ethereum grew, “some of NVIDIA’s sales personnel expressed their belief that much of the increased demand of the company’s Gaming products, primarily in China, was being driven by cryptomining,” the SEC order said. Senior executives at the company sought to capitalize on that demand with a specialized line of cards just for cryptomining, the SEC wrote, but Nvidia salespeople and the company’s internal estimates suggested cryptomining was still accounting for “a significant factor in the year-over-year growth in Gaming revenue.” In the company’s quarterly reports, Nvidia reported revenue increases of 52% and 25% for the second and third quarters of 2018, respectively, compared to those same quarters the year prior, according to the SEC. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC wrote. But because Nvidia failed to mention the role of cryptomining in those figures — while properly citing cryptomining in other areas of its report — it gave the misleading impression that Nvidia’s gaming growth was sustainable or organic, not due to demand for a volatile digital currency, the SEC said. “NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” Kristina Littman, who leads the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, said in a statement. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”",CNN
2020-03-16,Microsoft reveals details about its next-generation console Xbox Series X,"Microsoft revealed the technical specifications of its next generation video game console, the Xbox Series X, in a Monday blog post. Although pricing is still unknown, Microsoft said the Series X is coming this holiday season and has several new features that would give it a leg up over older consoles. The Series X will be capable of running 4K graphics at 60 to 120 frames per second, meaning that game graphics should display clear details and games will appear smooth even during action-packed scenes. The new console is also getting an upgraded graphics card and processor so it could run more graphic-intense games. Notably, high-end PCs are capable of running graphic-intense games at as much as 200+ frames per second, so this upgrade for Xbox brings its technical specs closer to what’s already available on the market for PC gamers. Consoles have lagged behind PCs when it comes to providing higher resolution in gaming, but are often more affordable and easier to set up than computers. Like its predecessor, the Xbox One X, the new console has one terabyte of storage, but it has been upgraded for faster load times. “Modern devices have changed our expectations on how quickly you can move between experiences or applications,” Xbox’s senior communications manager Will Tuttle wrote in a blog post. “Most of us want to be able to instantly jump into an experience or return right to where we left off.” With the upgrade, Xbox is claiming it will be possible to play a game to a certain point, turn off the console and perform a system update, and still get back to where you left off. Games with immersive open worlds like “Red Dead Redemption 2,” “Final Fantasy XV” and “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” could benefit from the faster load times, Xbox said. Tuttle wrote that Xbox has been working with TV manufacturers for the past two years to make sure displays are ready to support the Xbox Series X. Microsoft is also touting the new console’s ability to support older games. “As gamers themselves, [the team] understood that we all have our favorite memories, franchises or titles that we want to continue to play even as technology and game design continues to advance,” Xbox wrote. Since the Xbox Series X has upgraded storage and overall specs compared to the Xbox One X, it’s easier to support past games. “They gave us the Xbox One X and it was like we got this big playground to play with,” said Peggy Lo, principal program management lead of backward compatibility, in the blog post. “Then we got the Xbox Series X and it was like we had a whole amusement park to play in.”",CNN
2021-12-02,FTC sues to block Nvidia’s $40 billion takeover of Arm,"The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday sued to block US chipmaker Nvidia’s proposed $40 billion takeover of UK chip design firm Arm, saying it would stifle competition and give the combined company too much control over chip technology and designs. The lawsuit threatens to scuttle the world’s biggest ever semiconductor merger, which had already been the subject of regulatory scrutiny abroad. “Semiconductor chips power the computers and technologies that are essential to our modern economy and society,” the FTC said in a statement. According to its complaint, “the combined firm would have the means and incentive to stifle innovative next-generation technologies, including those used to run datacenters and driver-assistance systems in cars.” Nvidia         (NVDA) announced the agreement to buy Arm from Japanese tech investment firm SoftBank         (SFTBF) in September of last year, saying at the time it expected the deal to close within 18 months. But the merger has been a subject of global regulatory scrutiny, including from China as well as the United Kingdom, where Arm is based. The European Commission also launched an investigation into the deal just over a month ago. “We will continue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “Nvidia is committed to preserving Arm’s open licensing model and ensuring that its IP is available to all interested licensees, current and future.” Arm and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FTC said Thursday that it “cooperated closely with … competition agencies in the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea.” The trial is expected to begin on August 9 next year, according to the agency. The FTC is expected to take a tougher stance on antitrust and competition violations, particularly in the tech industry, under its recently appointed chair and noted Big Tech critic Lina Khan. Earlier this year, the agency rolled back a set of restrictions on how its officials could bring cases against antitrust violators, potentially making it easier to go after companies such as Amazon         (AMZN). Arm designs chips used by Apple and other major smartphone makers. The firm is based in Cambridge and is known as one of Britain’s most successful tech companies. The hurdle for the merger comes amid a significant shortage of computer chips around the world, affecting the availability of everything from smartphones to gaming consoles and even automobiles.",CNN
2020-02-04,"Nvidia launches its cloud gaming service, GeForce Now","American chipmaker Nvidia is entering the cloud gaming fray by launching its service GeForce Now on Tuesday. Nvidia began testing the service in January 2018 before Google and Microsoft announced they were testing their own cloud gaming products. But Nvidia took its time before an official launch. Cloud gaming lets people around the world play high-end video games on a tablet or phone without the need to lug around a console or PC. Companies are hoping cloud gaming will make video games more accessible and attract new gamers. Nvidia’s cloud gaming service is finally available for all users to try out. The subscription service has a free tier that allows a player to game for one hour at a time, while a $4.99 monthly subscription with a promotional 90-day free trial will let you game for six hours at a time. Those prices are far lower than other cloud gaming competition. While Google is planning to launch a free tier for Google Stadia, its subscription service costs $9.99 per month, with supporting hardware costing extra. Sony’s PlayStation Now also costs $9.99 monthly. Still, Nvidia’s cloud service doesn’t actually come with any games. It allows you to launch any free to play games, like “Fortnite,” “League of Legends” and “Destiny 2.” But for other paid games you will have to use existing PC game stores, like the Steam store and Epic Games Store, to expand your library. Nvidia believes there’s room in the cloud gaming market for GeForce Now to co-exist with offerings from major tech giants like Microsoft’s Project xCloud and Google Stadia. “We view cloud gaming as a journey. We’ve been at it for about five years. It’s not an easy technology to get to scale and working with publishers is not easy to scale either. And we view this as a ten year project, honestly, so we’re not too concerned about the timing,” said Phil Eisler, vice president and general manager of GeForce Now, about launching months after Google Stadia. “We think we’re the best choice for PC games.” GeForce Now supports cloud gaming on Mac, PC, TV, mobile and Chromebook. Several tests by CNN Business showed that the service works well and eliminates the need to download a game from scratch, but like other cloud gaming services, its effectiveness relies on how strong your Wi-Fi is. Perhaps what’s most unique about GeForce Now, compared to the other cloud gaming offerings, is that it makes it easier to game on MacOS, which is usually an unpopular platform for gaming partly because of the limited support for external graphics cards — which is what powers immersive gaming. “This isn’t to replace that big honking gaming computer that you might have already. But it’s for people who either can’t run the games, let’s say if you have a Mac or if you’re kind of in between and you don’t feel like buying a new [computer],” said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Phil Eisler, from GeForce Now, said that of the 300,000 users who tested the service, 80% of the time, they were playing on a machine that couldn’t otherwise play that game. “We do see a trend… where we are enabling new people to play and we’re excited about that,” said Eisler. “[Building a PC] is challenging and expensive and they just want to play games.”",CNN
2023-05-29,The world’s biggest ad agency is going all in on AI with Nvidia’s help,"WPP, the world’s largest advertising agency, has teamed up with chipmaker Nvidia to create ads using generative artificial intelligence. The companies announced the partnership Monday, with Nvidia         (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang unveiling WPP’s new content engine during a demo at Computex Taipei. “Generative AI is changing the world of marketing at incredible speed. This new technology will transform the way that brands create content for commercial use,” WPP CEO Mark Read said in a statement. The platform will enable WPP         (WPP)’s creative teams to integrate content from organizations such as Adobe and Getty Images with generative AI to produce advertising campaigns “more efficiently and at scale,” according to WPP         (WPP). This would enable companies to make large volumes of advertising content, such as images or videos, “more tailored and immersive,” the company added. In the demo screened by Huang, WPP had created realistic footage of a car driving through a desert. The new AI-powered content engine means that same car could be placed on a street in London or pictured in Rio de Janeiro to target the Brazilian market — all without the need for costly on location production. Just as advertising campaigns can be rapidly adapted for different countries or cities, they can also be customized for different digital channels, such as Facebook or TikTok, and their users. “You can build very finely tuned campaigns to resonate with an audience… On the other hand, you could make up imaginary scenarios that never existed in real life,” Greg Estes, vice president of developer programs at Nvidia told CNN. The platform is the latest example of how AI is being rapidly deployed by major companies to enhance productivity and deliver new products to customers. Many in the advertising and media industries are concerned about threats to their jobs because of the way that AI is able to aggregate information and create visual content indistinguishable from photography. WPP said its new platform “outperforms current methods” of having people “manually create hundreds of thousands of pieces of content using disparate data coming from disconnected tools and systems.” In other words, the new technology could mean that much smaller creative teams are ultimately able to do the same amount of work. “It’s much easier to identify the jobs that AI will disrupt than it is to identify the jobs that AI will create,” Read told the Financial Times Monday. “We’ve applied AI a lot to our media business, but very little to the creative parts of our business.” Nvidia’s Huang said: “The world’s industries, including the $700 billion digital advertising industry, are racing to realize the benefits of AI,” adding that WPP would now enable brands to “deploy product experiences and compelling content at a level of realism and scale never possible before.”",CNN
2024-02-23,Nvidia’s market value briefly catapults to $2 trillion,"Nvidia joined an exclusive club on Friday morning when its market value topped $2 trillion, just days after the chipmaker reported gangbusters earnings that once again swept Wall Street into an artificial intelligence-induced fervor. But the chipmaker’s stock pared some of its gains later in the day, leading its value to edge below the $2 trillion threshold by the market’s close. Nvidia added a staggering $273 billion to its market cap on Thursday, the biggest single-day jump of any company on record, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That came after the company on Wednesday evening reported a 769% annual gain in fourth-quarter profit and a 580% jump in full-year profits from the year earlier, blowing past analyst’s expectations. Only a handful of companies have ever hit the $2 trillion milestone, including Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia’s latest achievement comes after the company earlier this month surpassed Amazon and Alphabet in market value and become the third-largest company on Wall Street behind Microsoft and Apple. The company hit a $1 trillion market cap in 2023, about 24 years after going public. Its meteoric growth over the past year came as artificial intelligence mania consumed Wall Street and helped power a ferocious bull market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes closed at record highs on Thursday, after Nvidia’s eye-popping earnings fueled a broad rally. Nvidia has emerged the poster child of AI on Wall Street, in part because it is crucial to the burgeoning AI space.

The Santa Clara-based company said Wednesday in its annual report that Huawei was a competitor in four out of five major categories of its business, including supplying software and hardware for graphic processing units (GPUs), which are widely used in generative AI. Other companies also listed as its rivals in some areas include AMD (AMD), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Broadcom (AVGO). The naming of Huawei came just two months after Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia (NVDA), told reporters in Singapore that the Chinese tech giant was a “formidable” competitor in producing AI chips, according to a Reuters report. The Shenzhen-based firm, which makes smartphones and telecoms equipment, surprised the world last year by launching the Mate 60 Pro, a cutting-edge phone powered by advanced chips. Questions swirled over how Huawei was able to manufacture the phone when it had spent the four years under US restrictions banning its access to 5G technology. The breakthrough represented a “milestone” achievement for China, according to analysts, as Beijing and Washington are locked in a battle over semiconductor technology. In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed sweeping curbs designed to curtail China’s access to advanced computing chips. In early 2023, Japan and the Netherlands joined the US in curbing the export of chipmaking technology to China. Beijing has hit back. In April, 2023, it launched a cybersecurity probe into Micron before banning the company from selling to Chinese companies working on key infrastructure projects. In July, it imposed export controls on two strategic raw materials, gallium and germanium, that are critical to the global chipmaking industry. In October 2023, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms. Nvidia has flagged concerns about getting caught up further in the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. Its competitive position has been harmed and could be further impacted in the long term, if there are further changes in US export controls on chips, it said in the annual report. “In the event of such change [in US export control rules], we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East,” it said. Nvidia reported strong earnings on Wednesday. Its profits for the three months ended January 28 were up 769% from a year ago. But its China business took a hit from US restrictions on chip sales to the country. “Growth was strong across all regions except for China, where our data center revenue declined significantly following the US government export control regulations imposed in October [2022],” Colette Kress, Nvidia’s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call. Data centers, which includes the graphics cards, are Nvidia’s biggest source of revenue. Sales from its core data center business grew 409% year-over-year to a record $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter. She said China represented “a mid-single-digit percentage” of the company’s data center revenue in the fourth quarter, and is expected to stay in “a similar range” in the current quarter.

2021-07-26,A surprising tech company could be next to join the Dow,"Chip giant Nvidia is the ninth-most valuable company in the S&P 500. With a market capitalization of almost $500 billion, the company is now worth nearly as much as semiconductor rivals Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm — combined. Could Nvidia soon wind up listed on the venerable Dow, too? There’s a strong case to be made for Nvidia         (NVDA) joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most famous of market barometers. In fact, one could argue that Nvidia         (NVDA) might be a better fit than current chip king Intel         (INTC) or stodgy tech giant IBM         (IBM). To be sure, the chip maker’s annual sales still pale in comparison to Intel or IBM, which are both expected to generate more than $70 billion in revenue this year. But Nvidia’s revenue forecast of about $25 billion for this fiscal year isn’t too shabby. It’s also higher than the sales expectations for Dow components Visa         (V) and McDonald’s         (MCD), and on par with the revenue estimates for software giant Salesforce         (CRM), which was added to the Dow last year. Adding Nvidia could give the Dow more exposure to the lucrative industries of gaming and cryptocurrencies, as Nvidia’s graphics processing chips are a big part of high-end PCs used by gamers as well as for cryptocurrency mining rigs. There’s another big reason why there’s been more chatter lately about Nvidia potentially joining the Dow. (Investing sites Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha have both speculated about the possibility.) Nvidia, until recently, would have been too expensive for the Dow, which weights the 30 companies it lists by stock price. Shares of Nvidia had been trading north of $750 as of a few weeks ago. So putting it in the Dow at that price would have made it by far the biggest member of the index. UnitedHealth         (UNH), with a stock price of around $415, is the current top stock in the Dow, accounting for about 8% of the average. But Nvidia recently split its stock, which cut its share price by a quarter. Stocks now trade for around $190. There are a dozen Dow components that have a stock price higher than that. Apple         (AAPL) split its stock to a more Dow-friendly level before it was added to the blue chip average in 2015. And the fact that tech titans Amazon         (AMZN) and Google owner Alphabet         (GOOGL), which each have shares prices in the quadruple digits, have not split their stock recently is arguably the main reason why neither company is in the Dow — despite having market valuations approaching $2 trillion. Facebook         (FB) is another possible future Dow addition, too, given that it is now worth more than $1 trillion. The social media giant might need to split its stock as well though. At a price of nearly $375, Facebook would be the third-largest Dow component if added at current levels, trailing only UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs         (GS). That’s why Nvidia seems like a more logical Dow addition. Nvidia could also be an attractive option if the company’s planned purchase of UK-based mobile chip designer Arm from SoftBank goes through. The $40 billion purchase would make Nvidia an even bigger player in the world of tech. There are questions about whether that deal will pass regulatory muster, as it is being scrutinized by several agencies around the globe. There has even been speculation that Arm might pursue an initial public offering instead. Nvidia was not available for comment. A spokesperson for Arm told CNN Business that the company’s CEO, Simon Segars, has stated to The Telegraph that there are no plans for an IPO and that the company is focused on closing the Nvidia deal. A spokeswoman for S&P Dow Jones Indices, which has a committee in charge of making changes to the firms listed on the Dow, had no comment about the possible inclusion of Nvidia or any other changes to the index. It’s worth noting that the Dow did just have an overhaul. Salesforce was one of three new members that joined last year. Amgen         (AMGN) and Honeywell         (HON) were also added while Exxon Mobil         (XOM), Pfizer         (PFE) and Raytheon         (RTN) were given the boot. Stock split could set up Nvidia for Dow inclusion.",CNN
2022-08-25,Computer chips were in high demand. Then inflation kicked in,"When consumers were stuck inside during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, there weren’t many places to spend money. So they turned their attention to technology, scooping up new gaming consoles, monitors and PCs that made living and working from home a bit easier. Now, as people return to offices, gyms and restaurants and rethink their spending as inflation starts to bite, sales of gadgets are taking a hit — as are the companies making the chips that power them. What’s happening: Nvidia         (NVDA), which warned earlier this month that its sales were dropping due to weaker gaming revenue, shared earnings on Wednesday. The firm posted revenue between May and July of $6.7 billion, up 3% from one year ago but down 19% from the previous quarter. “This was a challenging quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts. “Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand.” Gaming revenue was dinged in part due to a decline in cryptocurrency mining that relies on Nvidia’s chips. Matt Bryson, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told me that the downturn was tied to the pullback in crypto prices, which has chilled enthusiasm in the sector, and to changes in how the digital coin ether is produced. Revenue of data center chips reached a record last quarter, but wasn’t as high as the company would have liked given supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead: The situation isn’t due to improve any time soon. The company said that revenue for its current quarter would come in around $5.9 billion, down 17% year-over-year, and that its gaming business would continue to retrench. Shares are off more than 3% in premarket trading on Thursday. Nvidia isn’t the only company in the industry that’s run into trouble. Last month, Intel         (INTC) posted a surprise loss, pointing to the “sudden and rapid decline in economic activity.” The firm forecast a sharp drop in PC chip sales this year as top customers tried to clear out existing inventory, a sign they’re expecting lower demand for products. “This weakness is pervasive across the semiconductor industry for companies that sell into either the PC space … or into the handset space,” Bryson said. “It comes back down to the consumer.” Problems are spread across markets, too. A report by analytics firm Canalys published on Thursday found that PC shipments from China fell by 16% in the second quarter, the worst decline in nine years. On the radar: Providing chips for data centers has been a huge revenue driver in recent years, as cloud offerings from companies like Google and Amazon have taken off. But there are concerns that Big Tech firms could pull back spending on this front if other parts of their businesses run into trouble. The fear, Bryson said, is that if companies spend less on Google ads, or Amazon customers don’t order as many items, those giants of the tech world (and the stock market) may turn more conservative. His question: “Will the struggles of the consumer ultimately affect them?” President Joe Biden’s student loan plan is a potential game changer for Americans drowning in debt. But what will it mean for the economy at a moment when policymakers are losing sleep over high inflation? The latest: Biden announced Wednesday that his administration will forgive $10,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 per year. Low-income graduates who went to college on Pell Grants will receive up to $20,000. This debt relief will give tens of millions of borrowers some breathing room at a time when the cost of living has skyrocketed. That said: The cancellation of student debt is being paired with a plan to lift the freeze on federal student debt payments beginning in January 2023. That means many Americans who haven’t had to pay down student loans since March 2020 will have to begin doing so, hurting their budgets. According to economists, this policy combination means the overall impact on the economy and prices will be minimal, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports. “The end of the moratorium will weigh on growth and inflation, while the debt forgiveness will support growth and inflation,” said Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. “The net of these cross-currents is largely a wash.” Moody’s estimates that the combined impact will reduce real GDP in 2023 by 0.05 percentage points, drive down unemployment by 0.02 percentage points and cut inflation by 0.03 percentage points. In other words, a drop in the bucket. “We’re talking about a really small impact,” said Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “But for individuals this makes a big difference.” ESG is a wonky acronym for finance professionals. But in red states, aligning investment decisions with good environmental, social and governance practices has become a political football, putting Wall Street on the defensive. This just in: Texas agencies could bar BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, and nine European firms — including UBS and Credit Suisse — from doing business in the state after its comptroller on Wednesday found that the companies were boycotting the energy industry, breaking a new law intended to protect the fossil fuel sector. “The environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,” Comptroller Glenn Hegar said. BlackRock         (BLK), which manages about $20 billion for public funds in Texas, criticized the decision by officials to politicize state pension funds, which it said would impact financial returns for retirees. It’s not just Texas. This week, Florida passed a resolution directing the state’s fund managers to ignore ESG factors when making investment decisions. My takeaway: ESG investments have struggled this year, since many funds have a lot of exposure to tech names that have been hammered hard by the market sell-off. But when I speak with investors, many say they have no choice but to consider how companies in their portfolios are tackling issues like the climate crisis, since this could have a big impact on future returns. Defending these decisions could become trickier should ESG become increasingly ensnared in America’s culture wars. But broadly speaking, firms are unlikely to change tack.

2020-05-05,"US has ""an efficiency issue"" when it comes to food shortages, union president says"," Americans will likely feel some food shortages depending on where they live as meat processing plants across the US struggle to stay open due to coronavirus concerns, Marc Perrone, the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, told CNN. But, he insisted the country did not have a food shortage. Instead he said the challenges the United States is dealing with are ""an efficiency issue."" He explained how the closures and absenteeism at meat processing plants are now showing up on grocery store shelves. ""Twenty percent of workers are not there, and therefore, the plant slows down to a point that it can’t produce as much as it was producing at maximum efficiency. Our entire system is based on efficiency. That’s one of the reasons we’ve had shortages inside the store,"" he said. Perrone called processing plants ""stationary cruise ships"" due to the way the virus has spread within them but said it wasn't always about a delay in closing a plant with an outbreak. ""The failure that we had was not necessarily because the processors weren’t willing to do something earlier. The failure we had was because we couldn’t get the personal protective equipment and the testing that we needed on the front side to get ahead of this,"" Perrone explained. He added: “I do think the federal government could take a more active role in safety standards inside the plant that were enforceable. I think the government could mandate the highest form of PPE for those workers in those plants because they’re standing so close to each other. I think that testing and tracing is significant to be able to make sure we can root out the virus out of the plant. And make sure they provide layers of PPE in those plants.""",CNN
2023-11-15,Tencent says it stockpiled Nvidia chips but seeks Chinese replacements,"Tencent rushed to build up “one of the largest inventories of AI chips in China” before US export restrictions took hold, an executive said Wednesday. Martin Lau, president of the Chinese tech giant, told analysts on an earnings call that it had purchased components from Nvidia (NVDA) early, allowing it to keep developing its generative AI model for at least “a couple of generations.” “One of the key things that we have done was actually we were the first to put in orders for [the] H800, and that allows us to have a pretty good inventory,” Lau said. He added that Tencent was now scouting new suppliers within China “for these training chips.” Lau did not specify when the purchase took place, but the H800 is among the products restricted from sale to China due to US export curbs announced last month, Nvidia said in October regulatory filings. It is one of the chipmaker’s advanced AI chips designed for use in data centers, the physical facilities used to store troves of electronic information. In late October, Nvidia disclosed that the just-announced restrictions had come into effect “immediately,” weeks earlier than scheduled. Over the past year, the United States and China have progressively escalated a feud over access to the most advanced semiconductors, as well as the materials and equipment needed to create the technology. Washington’s decision to reduce the types of semiconductors that American companies can sell to China last month further tightened a set of export controls first introduced in October 2022 on national security grounds. The Biden administration deems the latest measures necessary to prevent potential use of the hardware for China’s military advancement and to close loopholes in existing regulations. In response, Beijing has accused Washington of “weaponizing trade and tech issues.” The standoff has led other Chinese firms to build up their chip supplies. This month, one of China’s most prominent tech investors, Kai-Fu Lee, told Bloomberg that his new Beijing-based startup, 01.AI, had also stockpiled chips it needed for the near future. The company began assembling its reserve of chips earlier this year, even using borrowed funds from Lee’s venture firm Sinovation Ventures, because “we felt we had to,” he told the media outlet in an interview. The venture capital firm did not respond a request for comment on the matter. The practice of stockpiling is not new. In recent years, before it was slapped with crippling US trade restrictions in 2020, Chinese tech giant Huawei also “stockpiled a two-year supply of chips prior to US entity restrictions taking effect,” according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), has also “amassed a large number of machines and potentially also a large stockpile of spare parts that it can draw from,” the report said. While the US export ban currently does not “affect the development of Hunyuan and our AI capability in the near future,” Tencent is concerned it could affect its ability to resell components to other customers, according to Lau, referring to its AI bot. “Going forward, we will have to figure out ways to make … the usage of our AI chips more efficient,” namely by working to retain most of the company’s high-performance chips for training the model, he added. Hunyuan, which Tencent says is meant to denote “something that is all encompassing and without limit,” was launched by the Shenzhen-based company in September. The bot was developed specifically for corporate users, allowing them to catch up on meetings by viewing automated summaries or put together documents more efficiently, Lau told analysts. The platform is currently available on a limited basis to customers and the public, according to Tencent. The company has reported solid earnings for the quarter ended September, logging a 10% jump in revenue that met analyst expectations. Sales surged to 154.6 billion yuan ($21.3 billion) compared to the same period a year ago, while profit attributable to shareholders climbed 39% to 44.9 billion yuan ($6.2 billion).",CNN
2020-09-17,Nvidia’s $40 billion Arm deal might hit a snag with China,"The battle between the United States and China for control of critical technology could doom a record-breaking deal for British chip designer Arm. The proposal from Nvidia         (NVDA) to buy SoftBank-owned Arm for $40 billion requires regulatory approval from the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States and China. But universal approval isn’t guaranteed. And there’s already an indication that China might not be happy about an American firm owning an important and strategic player in the semiconductor industry. An op-ed published this week in The Global Times, a state-run Chinese tabloid, characterized California-based Nvidia’s deal for Arm as “disturbing” for the Chinese and European tech companies that rely on the company’s advanced chip designs. “If Arm falls into US hands, Chinese technology companies would certainly be placed at a big disadvantage in the market,” read the op-ed. Chinese regulators haven’t spoken publicly about the deal, but state-run media is often viewed as a barometer of sentiment among senior officials. And China’s influence is key: The last time a semiconductor deal of this size was attempted, it failed. In 2018, Beijing declined to approve American chip company Qualcomm         (QCOM)’s proposed $44 billion takeover Dutch counterpart NXP. Given the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, “we believe that obtaining all necessary global regulatory approvals will be challenging,” Citi analysts Atif Malik and Amanda Scarnati wrote in a note on Monday. Nvidia and Arm said they expect that the deal will take 18 months to close, “which we believe signals that they expect a protracted and detailed review by [the Ministry of Commerce] in China,” the analysts added. Semiconductors power everything from smartphones to self-driving cars. The industry has consolidated over the years because designing and manufacturing cutting edge computer chips requires huge amounts of cash for research and development. Arm, which is based in Cambridge and is known as one of Britain’s most successful tech companies, designs chips used by Samsung, Apple         (AAPL) and other major smartphone makers. Many leading Chinese semiconductor design firms — such as Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon — use Arm intellectual property for their cutting edge designs, too. “Arm has been really useful for China because UK [export] rules are a bit more lax,” said James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Nvidia and Arm have offered reassurances that the British firm will remain neutral. As part of Nvidia, Arm will continue “maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its success,” the companies said in a statement announcing the deal on Sunday. But if Arm is acquired by an American company, it would likely be subject to US regulations — and Washington has been increasingly using export controls to cut Chinese tech firms off from key technology. “If they moved to Nvidia they would fall under American export rules which have significantly tightened over the last few years,” Lewis said. Earlier this year the United States issued fresh sanctions against Huawei that restricted the Chinese tech company from buying chips from semiconductor manufacturers that use American machinery, software or technology. Analysts called the move a “lethal blow” and a “death sentence” for Huawei, which needs leading edge chips to power its smartphone and telecommunications gear. The US Department of Defense and other government agencies are also reportedly considering banning exports to SMIC, China’s biggest chipmaker, which would significantly hamper Beijing’s efforts to build an advanced domestic semiconductor industry. “Control over Arm by a US company could mean potentially more restrictions on use of Arm technology by Chinese firms that come under new export controls or other US regulatory action,” said Paul Triolo, head of geo-technology at Eurasia Group. He added that Chinese regulatory officials will likely “be looking for some conditions to place on the deal” to preserve access to that intellectual property. Arm has a joint venture in China, which is developing its own capacity for semiconductor intellectual property design, and Chinese regulators could “require Arm China to be spun off” to ensure it doesn’t come under US regulatory action, he said. Analysts at brokerage firm Morningstar point out that Nvidia received the green light from Chinese regulators earlier this year for its $7 billion acquisition of US-firm Mellanox, which sells networking and storage equipment. But “the magnitude and significance of this potential deal [to acquire Arm] will undergo heightened scrutiny, in our view,” Abhinav Davuluri, sector strategist with Morningstar, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The Global Times op-ed asked regulators to “extensively investigate and study the potential implications behind the deal,” adding that the “stakes behind the deal are high.” The “possibility that Arm could be politicized as a US technology weapon against China’s technology companies must be taken seriously,” the op-ed said. Being mentioned in such a manner by the Global Times “is not a good sign” for Nvidia, said Lewis, of CSIS. He called the paper an “excitable mouthpiece” for the Chinese government. And even if the Nvidia-Arm deal gets the go-ahead from China, it may not be entirely out of the clear. Some politicians in the United Kingdom have expressed concern about preserving jobs at Arm, which could come up as the deal is reviewed there. And Nvidia’s rivals — which purchase chip designs from Arm — are likely to object. — Michelle Toh contributed to this report. Tightening US restrictions. Winning over China.",CNN
2024-02-21,Is Nvidia too big to fail?,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. How big is too big? That’s the question on a lot of investors’ minds Wednesday as they wait for Nvidia to report its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 after the market closes. The California-based chipmaker has quickly become the third largest company on Wall Street, behind Microsoft and Apple, largely because of its critical role in the artificial intelligence boom — Nvidia makes up nearly all of the AI chipmaking market in the United States. But with a market cap of $1.7 trillion and a year-to-date return of about 40% (the best in the S&P 500), the company has a lot to live up to. Investors expect Nvidia to report earnings of $4.59 a share and $20.378 billion in revenue, up from just $6.05 billion a year before. “There’s a very realistic and probable chance they beat expectations but zero percent chance they meet the sentiment of those expectations,” said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, a tech advisory and research firm, noting that investors have come to expect huge earnings beats and the outsized hype around the company. Still, there’s some concern about whether this can last. Shares of Nvidia have quintupled since the end of 2022 as the AI revolution took hold, and it’s hard to imagine that such stratospheric growth can go on forever. “It’s the law of large numbers,” said Newman. “If you keep posting these remarkably strong quarters they start to look smaller.” Plus, he said, competition is emerging, albeit slowly. There’s plenty of room for growth ahead, just maybe not at the sky high rate investors have grown used to. Too big to fail: For the time being, Nvidia is the “most sophisticated and deployed” chipmaker in the world, and its output is one of national importance, said Newman. “From a national security standpoint, [the US] needs to be the leader in AI,” said Newman. “The economic future of the world depends on AI, and we can’t let China have the most advanced chips.” That’s the reason the US has invested $200 billion into the CHIPS and Science Act. While there’s competition from companies like Intel and AMD, Nvidia remains the biggest game in town for now. And because of its rapid growth, so many retirement savings accounts, institutions and life savings are heavily invested in the company’s success. At the recent World Government Summit in Dubai, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even suggested that governments should consider instituting sovereign AI infrastructure. That’s the idea that states should control the development of AI technology to best protect their national security, economy and culture as opposed to leaving corporations in charge. TL;DR: “Nvidia is robust and will continue to grow,” said Newman. “But it needs to continue at a rate that’s eye watering or investors will start looking at other plays.” What’s next: Wednesday is Nvidia’s big day, but Intel also has plans to share the spotlight. OpenAI founder Sam Altman, who is reportedly working on his own chip-making venture, will join Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger on stage at a company event. Investors will certainly be watching closely for any announcements. What’s in your wallet? Capital One is making a $35 billion bet that the answer will soon be: more of its credit cards. The bank announced Monday evening it is acquiring Discover Financial Services (DFS) in a $35.3 billion all-stock deal, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. If approved by regulators and shareholders, Capital One’s (COF) acquisition will create the biggest US credit card company by loan volume. So what does that mean for you? For now, not a lot. Given that the deal isn’t expected to be finalized until late 2024 or early 2025, Discover and Capital One customers shouldn’t anticipate any immediate changes. And antitrust regulators could push that deadline even further out: The Biden administration has established a strong anti-merger stance by attempting to block consolidation of corporate giants, from tech companies to airlines. But, down the road, there could be significant transformations. For starters, all Capital One debit cards will be switched from Mastercard to the Discover network “within the first few years” from when the deal is finalized, Richard Fairbank, founder and CEO of Capital One, said in a Tuesday morning investor call. Discover cards are already accepted at 99% of all US merchants that allow customers to make credit card purchases, according to the company. But Fairbank said people mistakenly believe that share is a lot lower. Consumers could also end up paying higher interest rates. Compared to other major credit card issuers, Capital One has historically catered to customers with credit scores in the 600s range, which is considered subprime. Given these borrowers are considered riskier, they tend to get charged higher interest rates compared to higher-scoring individuals. Capital One is among 15 credit card issuers that have at least one card with a maximum interest rate above 30%, according to a recent report published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Walgreens Boots Alliance is getting the boot from the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average and Amazon is taking its place, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index, said in a statement Tuesday that the change is intended to reflect “the evolving nature of the American economy” by increasing the Dow’s consumer retail exposure. The change means that investors who bet on the Dow Jones Industrial Average will now have exposure to Amazon’s stock performance. Amazon joins Apple and Microsoft as the third company from the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of high-performing tech stocks, to join the Dow 30. The other four companies in the group — Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, and Alphabet — are not included in the index, though all seven stocks are included in the much larger S&P 500 index. Historically, getting added to or dropped from the Dow hasn’t had a significant impact on companies’ stock performances. But presence in the index, which began in 1896, comes with a certain level of cachet. The exclusive group traditionally tries to mirror the most important companies in the US economy. That is why the index is so heavily dominated by technology stocks today. The change will occur before the US stock market’s opening on Monday, February 26.

2022-09-01,US orders Nvidia and AMD to stop selling AI chips to China,"Two of America’s top chipmakers have been ordered to stop selling some of their technology to China that can be used for artificial intelligence. Nvidia         (NVDA) and AMD         (AMD) said Wednesday that they had been told by the US government to halt exports of certain high-performance chips to the world’s second largest economy. In a regulatory filing, Nvidia said that it had been told by US officials that the requirement was due to a potential risk of the products being used by, or diverted to, a “military end user.” The restrictions cover Nvidia’s A100 and forthcoming H100 integrated circuits, and any systems that include them, effective immediately, it said. The move threatens to upend $400 million worth of business for Nvidia, according to the filing. That’s roughly what the California-based tech giant projected last week in potential sales to China, which could be affected by the new requirement, it said in the filing. Nvidia shares tumbled 6.6% in after-hours trading Wednesday, while AMD stock was down 3.7%. In a statement to CNN Business, Nvidia said it was working with “customers in China to satisfy their planned or future purchases with alternative products and may seek licenses where replacements aren’t sufficient.” AMD, which is also headquartered in California, told CNN Business it had also been given new requirements by the US Department of Commerce that will hit shipments of its MI250 integrated circuits to China. “At this time, we do not believe that shipments of MI100 integrated circuits are impacted by the new requirements,” it said, referring to another line of components. “We do not currently believe it is a material impact on our business.” The new rules are a reminder of how US-China tensions remain high over business and tech. Last week, a rare agreement between the two countries on auditing US-listed Chinese companies had suggested a breakthrough in relations, but experts have warned the deal will do little to resolve other key issues. The new mandate for chipmakers also covers a ban in exports to Russia, Nvidia and AMD noted. Both companies said they do not currently sell any products to Russia.",CNN
2023-08-23,Nvidia set the market alight last quarter. Can it repeat the trick?,"Artificial intelligence darling Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report could be a boost or a drag on a market already mired in the summer doldrums. Analysts expect the chipmaker to post second-quarter profit of $2.09 a share and revenue of about $11.2 billion after the closing bell on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv. What’s happening? Nvidia shares have been on a tear this year as the popularity of artificial intelligence has surged. The company produces chips that power generative AI, the type of artificial intelligence capable of creating new content including text, images and other media — and which forms the foundation of ChatGPT and several other buzzy AI services. When Nvidia reported first-quarter results, its earnings and sales shattered expectations. CEO Jensen Huang said during the post-earnings conference call in May that the company is ramping up its supply to meet “surging demand.” An upbeat earnings report from Nvidia could help lift the broader market, says Phillip Toews, chief executive officer at Toews Asset Management. That’s because Nvidia is the poster child of the AI enthusiasm that’s helped power stocks into a bull market, even as the US Federal Reserve has continued to hike interest rates in its battle against inflation. Shares of Nvidia have surged an eye-popping 212% this year, leading the gains in the “Magnificent Seven” stocks — which also include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla. Nvidia reached a $1 trillion market cap in May, becoming the ninth company to achieve that milestone. Tech stocks rose on Monday, indicating optimism among investors about Nvidia’s earnings. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index on Monday gained 1.6%, marking its biggest one-day jump this month and stalling the recent sell-off in tech stocks. “Expectations for the high values of tech to run out of gas after the blistering first half, and the rest of the market to see a partial catchup … has yet to occur,” wrote Louis Navellier, chairman of Navellier & Associates, in a Tuesday note. Can the tech rally last? Tech stocks faltered somewhat on Tuesday, as weak retail earnings and elevated Treasury yields put pressure on stocks. Investors tend to favor bonds when yields are attractively high. Still, the Nasdaq Composite was the only major index to finish Tuesday’s trading session positive, albeit by a small margin. Nvidia shares have risen roughly 5% so far this week, Tesla 8%, Meta 2% and Apple 2%. “We expect a bullish outlook from Nvidia that should be the fuel in the engine to continue this tech rally into the rest of the year,” wrote Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note on Monday. But any weakness in Nvidia’s earnings could send its shares and other tech names lower. Nvidia’s quarterly results aren’t the only risk to markets this week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a speech at the Kansas City Fed’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday.

US home buyers have a new challenge in addition to mortgage rates above 7%, reports my colleague Anna Bahney. Prices are rising again, reversing five months of year-over-year declines, according to a National Association of Realtors report released Tuesday. The median existing home price was $406,700 last month, up 1.9% from a year ago. It was the highest price for the month of July on record. Prices rose in the Northeast, Midwest and South but were unchanged in the West, the NAR report found. Prices were pushed up by the stubbornly low inventory of homes on the market — just 1.11 million existing homes were available to buy at the end of July, down 14.6% from a year ago. It was the lowest number of homes for sale on record for the month of July, which is typically one of the busiest months for buying and selling in the year. Homeowners are refusing to sell and are hunkering down with their ultra-low mortgage rates that are at least half the current rates, which are at their highest level in 21 years. Read more here. Threads users, rejoice. The app rolled out its highly anticipated web version Tuesday, reports my colleague Clare Duffy. The update — perhaps the most requested by users since Threads’ mobile-only launch last month — puts the new platform one step closer to recreating the functions offered by rival X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and could help reignite user growth following a sluggish period. Parent company Meta Platforms says Threads users will soon be able to log in, post, view and interact with other posts via a browser on a desktop computer, as the web version rolls out to users in the coming days. The company says it plans to add more desktop features. In an early access test of some of the web-based features, CNN was able to post on the platform but could not yet scroll the home feed.

2024-02-22,Nvidia CEO climbs billionaire list as company stock price skyrockets,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth saw a major boost on Thursday as the company he cofounded in 1993 surged in value. Now ranked by Bloomberg as the 21st richest person in the world, Huang expanded his wealth by as much as $8.5 billion on Thursday alone as his company’s stock price bumped up 15% in value during morning trading. Huang, 61, is now worth an estimated $68.1 billion, passing Charles Koch and rapidly gaining on members of the Walton family, who own Walmart, which has a roughly $471 billion market cap. The list is topped by the Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault and Jeff Bezos. Huang has been at the helm of Nvidia since its beginning, serving as co-founder, CEO, president and board member. He owns around 3% of the company. The Taiwanese-born tech leader attended Oregon State University and Stanford University before working at now-competitor chip company LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and then launching Nvidia with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Malachowsky remains at Nvidia, while Priem left the company in the early 2000s. Nvidia, now one of the largest companies on the stock market valued at just under $2 trillion, led gains Thursday after reporting extraordinary earnings growth, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Huang said in a statement on Wednesday evening that generative AI has now “hit the tipping point.” “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” he added. His words led to an explosive morning on Wall Street Thursday, a rapid reversal from earlier in the week when the company logged its worst day since October. Profits of the chipmaker grew to nearly $12.3 billion in the three months ended January 28 — up from $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, a gain of 769% year-over-year and even stronger growth than Wall Street analysts had expected. That result helped bring the company’s full-year profits up more than 580% from the year earlier. Other chipmakers benefited from Nvidia’s good news. Shares of AMD (AMD) were 11% higher on Thursday and Microsoft (MSFT) rose 2%. Nvidia is crucial to the burgeoning AI space. The American chipmaker accounts for around 70% of AI semiconductor sales in the world. It is unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the buzzy new technology that can create text, images and other media. Nvidia’s growth was highlighted in its earnings, even as Meta, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft have all begun producing some of their own chips, according to Dan Morgan, vice president at Synovus Trust Company. Sales from the company’s core data center business grew 409% year-over-year to a record $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter, thanks to partnerships with infrastructure giants like Google, Amazon and Cisco. But the company’s soaring stock price over the past year — shares grew around 230% in 2023 — means Nvidia is now deeply important to the broader market, too. In a note on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts called Nvidia “the most important stock on planet earth.” CNN’s Clare Duffy and Nicole Goodkind contributed to this report.",CNN
2020-09-14,SoftBank is selling British chipmaker ARM to Nvidia for $40 billion,"Nvidia is buying British chipmaker ARM from SoftBank for as much as $40 billion — a total that would make it the largest semiconductor deal ever. The agreement, announced Sunday, will be financed through a mix of cash and stock, the companies said in a joint statement. The move would allow Nvidia         (NVDA) — which mainly makes graphics processors for computer games and self-driving cars — to become an industry leader across more connected devices, including smartphones, PCs, robotics and 5G, CEO Jensen Huang wrote in a letter to employees Sunday. ARM designs chips used by Apple         (AAPL) and other major smartphone makers. The firm is based in Cambridge and is known as one of Britain’s most successful tech companies. Nvidia said Sunday that it plans to keep Arm’s headquarters in Cambridge, as well as expand its campus with a new research facility. “ARM’s business model is brilliant. We will maintain its open-licensing model and customer neutrality, serving customers in any industry, across the world, and further expand ARM’s [intellectual property] licensing portfolio,” Huang wrote. The deal is likely to come under significant scrutiny in the United Kingdom, where some politicians are concerned about preserving jobs at ARM. Nvidia’s rivals — which purchase chip designs from ARM — are also likely to object. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said Monday that the UK government will not hesitate to investigate any takeover that could have a major impact on the country. The deal comes four years after SoftBank bought ARM for $32 billion, marking the largest foreign takeover by a Japanese firm at the time. SoftBank has been working to divest assets in recent months as the conglomerate looks to raise cash in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In March, it announced a plan to sell $41 billion worth of assets, and last month it doubled down with a partial sale of its stake in its Japanese mobile carrier affiliate. SoftBank shares in Tokyo were up nearly 9% Monday following the news. The Financial Times also reported Monday that SoftBank is reconsidering a plan to privatize the company. SoftBank declined to comment on the report. “The combination is likely to lift SoftBank’s share price in Tokyo,” wrote Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda, in a note to clients. If the ARM deal goes through, it will be the semiconductor industry’s biggest-ever deal, topping Avago’s acquisition of Broadcom in 2015, according to Dealogic. Under the agreement, Nvidia will pay about $12 billion in cash and $21.5 billion in stock. SoftBank will receive a stake of less than 10% in Nvidia, and the Japanese company will also be eligible for a payout of up to $5 billion if ARM meets “specific financial performance targets,” according to SoftBank. The company did not disclose the targets. The deal is expected to close within 18 months. It will first have to pass regulatory approvals from the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States and China. — Luke McGee and Charles Riley contributed to this report.

2023-12-06,Nvidia is developing new chips for China to comply with US export curbs,"Nvidia is working closely with the US government to ensure new chips for the Chinese market are compliant with export curbs, CEO Jensen Huang said on Wednesday. The California-based artificial intelligence chip designer has commanded more than 90% share of China’s $7 billion AI chip market, but analysts have said new U.S. curbs on chip exports are likely to create opportunities for Chinese rivals to make inroads. Reuters last month reported Nvidia (NVDA) had told customers in China it was delaying the launch of a new China-focused AI chip until the first quarter of next year. Huang declined to confirm the Reuters article. “Nvidia has been working very closely with the US government to create products that comply with its regulations,” Huang told a news conference in Singapore. “Our plan now is to continue to work with the government to come up with a new set of products that comply with the new regulations that have certain limits.” He added Nvidia needs to seek the advice of the market and the process is ongoing, adding that Huawei was a “formidable” competitor. Nvidia warned during its November earnings that it expects a steep drop in fourth-quarter sales in China in the wake of the new U.S. rules. Huang noted that China’s revenue contribution to Nvidia has been traditionally around 20% but it was hard to predict how much that would change with the new U.S. export restrictions. Separately, he said Nvidia was in talks with Singapore about potential big investments and working with the city-state to help develop its own large language model, Sealion. Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) announced on Monday a S$70 million ($52 million) initiative to develop Southeast Asia’s first large language model. Huang noted Singapore had a vibrant AI ecosystem and its role as a major data center for many Asian markets.",CNN

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Nvidia isn’t the only stock capturing the attention of AI enthusiasts these days. Nvidia is undoubtedly the poster child for artificial intelligence. Shares of the American chipmaker have soared roughly 277% over the last 12 months, helping drive a powerful bull market that’s led stocks to record highs. Nvidia closed above a $2 trillion market cap on March 1, joining an elite cohort including Apple and Microsoft. But there’s another AI-related stock that has quietly logged eye-popping gains. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) have surged about 296% so far in 2024, following a 246% jump in 2023. Supermicro’s stock gained even more momentum in January, after the company reported second-quarter results that blew past expectations and raised its full-year revenue forecast. Supermicro’s stock was one of the most popular names bought by Charles Schwab clients in February, according to the firm’s latest trading activity index. The server producer counts Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices among its customers. Its stock had risen at a breakneck pace even before last year’s bull market. The shares jumped roughly 87% in 2022, while other tech names and the broader market got pummeled as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively to bring down wayward inflation. Supermicro’s runaway gains are indicative of the burgeoning demand for high-quality infrastructure to support AI chips, after the creation of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 kickstarted a race among tech behemoths to develop generative AI platforms and tools. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom. The chipmaker, which produces processors that power AI systems, reported last month that its full-year profits grew more than 580% from the prior year. “Everyone’s looking for something that looks and smells and tastes like Nvidia. … [Supermicro] is exactly that,” said Victoria Bills, chief investment strategist at Banrion Capital Management. Supermicro has a market cap of roughly $63 billion, up from $5 billion just a year ago. The stock is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index at its next quarterly rebalance. Wall Street thinks it has more room to run. Bank of America analysts initiated coverage on Supermicro last month with a “buy” rating and price objective of $1,040, which the stock has already surpassed, closing at $1,124.70 a share on Wednesday. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs analysts also recently initiated coverage. “The company’s willingness to experiment with different combination of components, its close proximity to leading semiconductor companies in San Jose and the fact that a majority of its manufacturing is in the United States is a competitive advantage,” wrote BofA analysts in a February 15 report. Beleaguered regional lender New York Community Bank is receiving a more than $1 billion equity investment, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. The majority of the investment, $450 million, is coming from former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital. The remaining sum will come from Hudson Bay Capital, Reverence Capital Partners, Citadel Global Equities and “other institutional investors and certain members of the Company’s management,” according to an announcement NYCB made Wednesday afternoon. The bank’s stock plunged more than 40% earlier on Wednesday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the bank was seeking a major cash infusion. After the deal was announced, the stock shot up 31% but those gains quickly leveled off. Ultimately, shares of NYCB closed 7% higher for the day after trades settled. The money “provides a lifeline,” David Chiaverini, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN. In addition to the investment, NYCB announced Joseph Otting, a former comptroller of the currency, will replace Alessandro DiNello as CEO. DiNello, who was named CEO less than a week ago, will now become non-executive chairman. Read more here. UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced a tax cut for workers Wednesday as he unveiled what is likely to be the government’s last budget before a general election later this year, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. Hunt cut national insurance — a levy paid by people who work — by two percentage points. That means an additional £450 ($572) a year for the average employee or £350 for someone who is self-employed. It’s the second such cut in a matter of months. “If we want to encourage hard work, we should let people keep as much of their own money as possible,” Hunt said. But soaring UK government debt, crumbling public services and a lackluster economy left the chancellor with very little room for further substantial giveaways. The economy barely grew in 2023, slipping into recession at the end of the year in stark contrast with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s pledge to generate growth. In 2024, the Bank of England sees output expanding just 0.25%, while the International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of 0.6%. Hunt’s Conservative Party is trailing the opposition Labour Party by a wide margin in opinion polls, which had put him under enormous pressure to unveil tax cuts — however small — in a last-ditch bid to win voters.

2023-06-29,Nvidia says US curbs on AI chip sales to China would cause ‘permanent loss of opportunities’,"Nvidia warned Wednesday that if the United States imposes new restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, it would result in a “permanent loss of opportunities” for US industry. The company’s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said she didn’t anticipate any “immediate material impact” but tighter curbs would impact earnings in the future. US officials plan to tighten export curbs announced in October to restrict the sale of some artificial-intelligence chips to China, according to multiple media reports, including the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. Washington has ramped up efforts to cut China off from key technologies that can support its military. The US Department of Commerce has not replied to a CNN request for comment. The rules, as reported, could make it harder for companies like Nvidia         (NVDA) to sell advanced chips to China. Fueled by a boom in demand for its AI chips, the company briefly hit a market capitalization of $1 trillion in late May. “We are aware of reports that the US Department of Commerce is considering further controls that may restrict exports of our A800 and H800 products to China,” Kress told an investment conference. “Over the long-term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our datacenter GPUs to China, if implemented, would result in a permanent loss of opportunities for US industry to compete and lead in one of the world’s largest markets and impact on our future business and financial results,” she said. GPUs refer to graphics processing units, which are chips or electronic circuits capable of rendering graphics for display on electronic devices. “Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that such additional restrictions, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact on our financial results. We do not anticipate any immediate material impact on our financial results,” Kress added. Last October, the Biden administration unveiled a sweeping set of export controls that ban Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license. The new move is aimed in part at Nvidia’s A800 chip, which the US-based company created following the introduction of last year’s curbs in order to continue to sell to China, Bloomberg reported. China is a key market for Nvidia. Revenues from mainland China and Hong Kong accounted for 22% of the company’s revenue last year, according to its financial statements. On Wednesday, shares of Nvidia slumped as much as 3.2%, before recouping some of the losses. It ended down 1.8%. Chinese AI stocks suffered much heavier losses. Inspur Electronic Information Industry fell by 10%, the maximum allowed, on Wednesday in Shenzhen. It dropped again by 5.3% on Thursday. Chengdu Information Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences slid 12% on Wednesday. Baidu         (BIDU), which is developing a rival to ChatGPT, sank 4.4% on Thursday in Hong Kong. “The US could ruin China’s AI party,” Jefferies analyst said in a research note. Local chipsets do not have Nvidia’s GPU ecosystem, thus every update may require reworking, resulting in lower efficiency and higher costs. The Biden administration’s chip curbs would be “much more effective” in limiting China’s advances in military power driven by AI than rules restricting US investment in China’s tech sector, the analysts added. China has strongly criticized US restrictions on tech exports, saying earlier this year that it “firmly opposes” such measures. In May, Beijing banned Chinese operators of critical information infrastructure from buying products from Micron Technology         (MU), in apparent retaliation against sanctions imposed by Washington and its allies on the country’s chip sector.",CNN
2024-02-21,AI boom drove Nvidia profits up 580% last year,"Last year was a breakout year for artificial intelligence, and no company benefited from the trend quite like chipmaker Nvidia. Earnings released on Wednesday show Nvidia’s profits grew to nearly $12.3 billion in the three months ended January 28 — up from $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, a gain of 769% year-over-year and even stronger growth than Wall Street analysts had expected. That result helped bring the company’s full-year profits up more than 580% from the year earlier. Nvidia also posted fourth quarter revenue gains of 265% year-over-year, also exceeding analyst projections, as the company continues to ride the wave of massive AI investment. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement Wednesday. In a call with analysts following the report, Huang compared the broad adoption of AI technology to the start of a new industrial revolution. Nvidia is crucial to the burgeoning AI space. The American chipmaker is unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the buzzy new technology that can create text, images and other media. Nvidia accounts for around 70% of AI semiconductor sales, even as Meta, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft have all begun producing some of their own chips, according to Dan Morgan, vice president at Synovus Trust Company. Sales from the company’s core data center business grew 409% year-over-year to a record $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter, thanks to partnerships with infrastructure giants like Google, Amazon and Cisco. But the company’s soaring stock price over the past year — shares grew around 230% in 2023 — means Nvidia is now deeply important to the broader market, too. In a note on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts called Nvidia “the most important stock on planet earth.” Nvidia was the top performing S&P 500 stock in 2023. Nvidia’s shares jumped nearly 7% in after-hours trading following Wednesday’s report. But some shareholders worry that massive growth can’t last forever. And US restrictions introduced last year on exports of advanced AI chips to China, which affected products like Nvidia’s H800 and A800 chips, threaten to choke off access to a massive and fast-growing market. The company acknowledged that data center sales to China “declined significantly” in the January quarter because of the restrictions, although other regions nonetheless contributed to strong growth in the unit. “However, if Nvidia does not find a long-term workaround to the restrictions, it could start to trickle down into future growth,” Morgan said in emailed commentary ahead of Wednesday’s report. Nvidia executives said on the earnings call that the company has already begun shipping alternative chips to China that don’t violate the restrictions. CFO Colette Kress said China represented a mid-single-digit percentage of its overall data center business in the fourth quarter and is expected to remain in a similar range in the current quarter. Despite the China jitters, others on Wall Street believe the company still has plenty of room to run. “The outlook for Nvidia is positive as AI chip competition from Intel, AMD, Meta and Microsoft could be months away while demand for Nvidia chips is only surging,” Insider Intelligence senior analyst Gadjo Sevilla said in a note earlier this week. For now, the company says demand for its advanced AI chips continues to “exceed supply,” Kress said on Wednesday’s call. “Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry.” Ensuring that supply meets the booming demand may be a challenge for the company as it heads into this year. However, the company’s “cycle times are improving … overall, our supply is increasing very nicely,” Huang said. The company said Wednesday that it projects revenue for the current quarter to come in around $24 billion, which would mark a 233% increase from the year-ago quarter and is ahead of what Wall Street had expected.",CNN
2023-05-25,AI chip boom sends Nvidia’s stock surging after whopper of a quarter,"The AI boom is here, and Nvidia is reaping all the benefits. Shares of Nvidia         (NVDA) exploded 28% higher Thursday after reporting earnings and sales that surged well above Wall Street’s already lofty expectations. That was enough to make investors temporarily forget about America’s dangerous debt ceiling standoff, sending the broader stock market higher — even after credit rating agency Fitch warned late Wednesday that America could soon lose its sterling AAA debt rating. Nvidia makes chips that power generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text and images, in response to user prompts. That’s the kind of AI underlying ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, Dall-E and many of the other new AI technologies. “The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,” said Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, in a statement. “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.” Huang said Nvidia is increasing supply of its entire suite of data center products to meet “surging demand” for them. Last quarter, Nvidia’s profit surged 26% to $2 billion, and sales rose 19% to $7.2 billion, each easily surpassing Wall Street analysts’ forecasts. Nvidia’s outlook for the current quarter was also significantly — about 50% — higher than analysts’ predictions. Nvidia’s stock is up nearly 110% this year. “There is not one better indicator around underlying AI demand going on … than the foundational Nvidia story,” said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. “We view Nvidia at the core hearts and lungs of the AI revolution.”",CNN
2023-08-23,Nvidia’s quarterly sales double on the back of AI boom,"The artificial intelligence boom continues to fuel a blockbuster year for chipmaker Nvidia. Nvidia’s stock jumped as much as 9% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the Santa Clara, California-based company posted year-over-year sales growth of 101%, to $13.5 billion for the three months ended in July — a new record for the company. The results were even stronger than the $11.2 billion in revenue that Wall Street analysts expected. The company’s non-GAAP adjusted profits grew a stunning 429% from the same period in the prior year to $2.70 per share, also beating analysts’ expectations. GAAP stands for generally accepted accounting principles. Nvidia expects revenue to be even higher in the current quarter: forecasting revenue of $16 billion for its fiscal third quarter. “Demand for our data center platform for AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers.” Nvidia’s chief financial officer Colette Kress said on the company’s earnings conference call about the forecast. Nvidia’s stock has climbed by just over 220% since the start of this year amid a surge in the popularity of and demand for artificial intelligence technology. The American chipmaker produces processors that power generative AI, technology that can create text, images and other media — and which forms the foundation of buzzy new services such as ChatGPT. Nvidia also announced that its board authorized a $25 billion share buyback program. Buyback programs can signal that a company’s management believes its stock is currently undervalued. “A new computing era has begun. Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, adding that the company is working with “Leading enterprise IT system and software providers … to bring NVIDIA AI to every industry.” “The race is on to adopt generative AI,” he said. Huang had said following the company’s May earnings report that the firm was ramping up its supply to meet “surging demand.” “Nvidia’s hardware has become indispensable to the AI-driven economy,” Insider Intelligence senior analyst Jacob Bourne said in emailed commentary. “The pressing question is whether Nvidia can consistently exceed the now-higher expectations.” The chipmaker’s gaming division, once its main business, grew to $2.5 billion — an 11% increase from the previous quarter and a 22% jump year-over-year. “We believe global demand has returned to growth after last year’s slowdown,” Kress said of Nvidia’s gaming unit. However, not all of Nvidia’s businesses grew. Second-quarter revenue for the chipmaker’s professional visualization unit, which makes high-end graphics, was $379 million, down 24% from one year ago.",CNN
2023-08-24,Why Wall Street’s obsession with a company you probably never heard of is sending stocks surging,"The stock market has boomed this year, and one big reason is a company without much name recognition — unless you’re a hard core video gamer. Nvidia (NVDA) has surged 222% this year, including a 3% bump Thursday following super impressive earnings. Although it’s been known for graphics processors, Nvidia has now become almost synonymous with AI, after successfully diving head-first into the production of the type of microchip that powers the promising technology. Demand has outpaced supply, making Nvidia the hottest of hot stocks: It’s leading the S&P 500 this year by a mile, and is now one of only a handful of companies with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Investor enthusiasm for AI has also helped boost other tech stocks. Meta is up 144% this year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has grown 31%. But Nvidia is by far the most sought-after AI stock. The American chipmaker produces the building blocks of generative artificial intelligence (think ChatGPT and the like). The Santa Clara, California-based company posted year-over-year sales growth of 101% in the second quarter. Revenue went from $6.7 billion in the second quarter last year to $13.5 billion this year. The results were even stronger than the $11.2 billion in revenue that Wall Street analysts expected. This is the second time in a row that Nvidia’s quarterly earnings have blown past expectations. Its success is beginning to provide assurances that the AI gold rush is not just a flash in the pan. AI enthusiasm has helped power stocks into a bull market, even as the Federal Reserve has continued to hike interest rates in its battle against inflation. “Nvidia’s hardware has become indispensable to the AI-driven economy,” Insider Intelligence senior analyst Jacob Bourne said in an email following the blockbuster earnings report. “The pressing question is whether Nvidia can consistently exceed the now-higher expectations.” It shouldn’t have too much let-up: Demand for generative AI will remain robust over the next two years as apps for the new technology explode and become broadly deployed across companies, said Raj Joshi, senior vice president for Moody’s Investors Service, in a note to investors.",CNN

The 20-megapixel camera has a flash that's optimized to reduce red eye, and its own dedicated button. There's also a new version of Microsoft Band activity tracker, which now integrates Cortana and includes a barometer for measuring elevation. The screen uses Gorilla Glass. The new version will be available October 30, and can be pre-ordered today for $250. Finally, the company talked about updates to Xbox One, which will get a new controller this holiday season, as well as a TV app. And it demonstrated Project XRay, a ""mixed-reality"" prototype game for Microsoft's upcoming HoloLens hardware. The game customizes itself to the room you're in, and includes ""wearable"" holograms, such as armor you can place on your body. Copyright © 2005-2015 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

2012-06-05,Nvidia GeForce GTX 680M GPU Adds Keplar Strength to Top-Tier Line-Up,"Today Nvidia announced the GeForce GTX 680M, a version of the GPU maker's high-end graphics solution that's infused with the power of Keplar, its latest design process. The 680M marks a new top-performance graphics solution that is powerful enough to facilitate HD gaming but cool enough to keep thin notebooks--like Ultrabooks--from over-heating. It's well-known that the Keplar generation of graphics cards pack superlative performance. Thanks to smaller 28-nanometer design and special built-in features like improved anti-aliasing technology for rendering smoother lines, Keplar outperformed several other chip solutions including two notebooks with high-end AMD Radeon graphics in our benchmark tests. We have yet to test the 680M GPU, but with 2GB of video RAM and support for an arsenal of killer Nvidia features like Optimus switchable graphics and 3D Vision 2 technology, the new GeForce GPU isn't likely to disappoint. Look for the 680M in upcoming Alienware M17x and M18x models, the MSI GT70, and new machines from Ava Direct, Maingear, and Origin.",FoxNews
2023-12-18,Why does Washington want to kill off America's 'Magnificent 7?',"Nothing exemplifies America's tech industry dominance in the global economy more than the meteoric rise of what is now being called the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These companies single-handedly account for nearly all the gains in the stock market this year. They -- which is to say we, as American shareholders who own them -- have a net worth of nearly $10 trillion. Think about it. None of these gazelles are Japanese, German or Chinese. All seven are American companies. They are globally dominant. They are innovators nearly unrivaled in human history. Amazingly, you would think their best years are behind them, like an aging baseball player. No. They are getting stronger, not weaker. As a consequence, they are keeping the 401(k) and retirement plans owned by more than 100 million Americans in the green. These are the General Motors, Standard Oil, J.P. Morgan and U.S. Steel of the 21st century. Yet, here's the mystery. In Washington and among the political class, instead of being lionized for their amazing products, they are like Rodney Dangerfield: they get no respect. Worse, Democrats, Republicans and federal regulators have their carving knives out for them. Apparently, making a profit, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and adding trillions of dollars of consumer welfare are now nefarious pursuits in America where, to paraphrase Calvin Coolidge, the business of America is supposed to be business. Or, to put it in more modern terms, as Jerry Maguire would say, ""Show me the money!"" These powerhouses have certainly done that. Many Democrats want to break up Big Tech companies because they are too dominant. They don't seem to understand that it's far preferable to be dominant than inferior. There is also a teeny-weeny problem with the accusation that these firms engage in monopolistic behavior. Every one of them has substantially lowered prices for consumers -- in cellphones, in social media interactions, in the cost of products delivered right to your door, laptop computers and artificial intelligence. Or how about gaining instant access to almost any information you want? Google puts virtually the entire Library of Congress at your fingertips -- and astonishingly for free. The villains! Even more absurd is the claim that the multitrillion-dollar size and influence of these companies is squeezing out the smaller entrepreneurial companies that dare compete with them. That happens sometimes. But the bigger impact of these behemoths is to breathe life into literally thousands of startups that attract capital based on the dream that five years from now, they will be acquired at 20 times their current value by, say, Microsoft or Meta. Then there are those on the Right who want to tether the Magnificent Seven because they don't like their leftist politics or the suppression of conservative voices on their platforms. I share their concerns, but it's a free country, and they own the products and megaphones. There are plenty of alternatives if you don't like their public policy positions. Congress is intent on killing the Google -- er, the goose -- that lays the golden eggs. Apparently, they'd rather have us all be poorer and buy our cellphones and search engines and robots from China or India. One of the ironies of calling America's tech giants the Magnificent Seven is that in the 1960 movie of that title, five of the seven are killed in the last scene. In this age of Mach 5-speed innovation, that could eventually happen to Google and Apple -- and sooner than you think. It's not easy to remain the king of the hill. These companies have stayed erect by constantly innovating and giving customers more for less. But when they get knocked down to Earth, let's hope it's because of the forces of free market competition, not government regulators trying to fix something that surely ain't broke. Here's the final irony of this war against the Magnificent Seven. If the politicians do succeed in driving these epic American companies to their knees, there will be a hullabaloo about how America is losing its tech dominance. Then the knuckleheads in Washington will start passing out billion-dollar taxpayer subsidies to the very companies they now set out to impede and destroy.",FoxNews
2022-07-21,Nancy Pelosi blasted by Twitter users after denying she gave info to husband for stock trades: ‘LIES’,"Twitter users slammed Nancy Pelosi on Thursday after the Speaker of the House was confronted on whether she ever provided her husband knowledge that he could use to make informed stock trading decisions. Paul Pelosi made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry. Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million shares of Nvidia, a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC failed to mention Paul Pelosi on the air from when it broke on July 15 through primetime on Monday, according to a search of transcripts conducted by Fox News Digital. But, Pelosi said her husband has never made stock purchases based on information she gave him when asked by Fox News Digital. ""No, absolutely not,"" Pelosi said, before walking away from the podium. A video of the interaction quickly spurred conversation online, with many Twitter users accusing Pelosi of lying and partaking in insider trading, a felony that could land someone up to 20 years in prison if convicted. ""No, it's just an absolute coincidence that Pelosi's husband bought shares in a semiconductor company that Nancy is about to give over $50 billion in tax dollars,"" Greg Price, a senior digital strategist at X Strategies quipped. He subsequently replied with a meme of Anchorman character Ron Burgundy saying ""I don’t believe you."" Peter Tarr, a private fund manager, slammed people that would choose to believe Pelosi’s denial, and stated that he believed all politicians were ""terrible."" Comedian Tim Young reacted to the video of Pelosi by comparing it side by side to a famous Dave Chappelle skit about political corruption. John Dennis, a Republican candidate for Congress poised to take on Pelosi in San Francisco, used the opportunity to promote his campaign and ask his followers if they believed the House speaker. The official Twitter account of Choice, a retirement application that provides users free bitcoin, also poked fun at the House speaker. ""The absolute audacity. Imagine being married to someone and not knowing what they are investing in or what policies they are working on Stop letting these people get away with LIES!,"" YouTuber personality and Bitcoin consultant Wendy O tweeted. Several others also slammed Pelosi over the interaction. Fox News’ Brian Flood contributed to this report.",FoxNews
2015-12-14,Best Streaming Devices for Gaming,"If you’re hoping for a gift-wrapped game console to appear under the tree this year, you might be surprised to see a smaller-than-average box. And what's inside could be a streaming device instead of a dedicated gaming machine. The best streaming devices still pump out House of Cards episodes as their main activity, but they are also becoming miniature game consoles, with many popular titles available. Can they replace a new Microsoft Xbox or Sony Playstation for dedicated gamers? Well, you won’t find anything as expansive as Fallout 4 or graphically beautiful as Journey on a streaming device. But if you just want to kick back between movies and shoot some aliens or anger some birds, the best streaming devices for gaming might be all you need. The Apple TV ($149) is a great choice for a casual gamer. It comes with a touchpad remote, but one that's more suitable for navigation than knocking out opponents. All games on the Apple TV will work with the remote, but you'll be happier playing with a traditional game controller from a company such as Steelseries or Hori. Right now there aren’t many games available for the Apple TV, but you can use Airplay to send games from your iOS device to your TV and bring your Hearthstone games to life on a bigger screen. An Amazon Prime subscription brings the streaming portion of the Amazon Fire TV ($139) to life, giving you access to more than a million songs, thousands of movies, and online storage for your own photos and videos. And, according to Amazon, more than 800 games can be played through the Amazon Fire TV. Buying the gaming edition gets you the streaming box, an Xbox-like controller that supports voice commands and private listening through a headphone jack, and two great games right off the bat, Shovel Knight and Disney DuckTales: Remastered. And the Fire TV supports watch 4K Ultra HD programming. (You do, of course, need at 4K TV.) The closest thing to a true gaming console in the streaming player world is the NVIDIA Shield TV ($199). It looks like a futuristic DVD player but runs Android TV, letting it access the Google Play Store and play compatible games with the included controller. Yeah, it can run apps like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, as you'd would expect, but the ace up its sleeve is an NVIDIA exclusive. True to NVIDIA's gaming heritage, Shield TV includes the company’s game streaming service, GEForce Now. Similar to the way Netflix streams movies, GEForce Now streams games such as LEGO Hobbit, Batman: Arkham City, and Ultra Street Fighter IV for $7.99 per month, at up to 1080p. If you’ve already got a PC that you use for games, NVIDIA’s GameStream feature lets you play your local PC games on your TV, as long as you have a compatible graphics card. Any way you slice it, the Shield TV is great for gamers who are mainly interested in a streaming device. Copyright © 2005-2015 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

2012-11-09,Nvidia CEO: Great Tablet Better Than a Cheap PC,"Need more proof that tablets are taking over? Just ask Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO of Nvidia. In the past, Nvidia and its discrete graphics offerings feasted or starved based on the way the winds were blowing in the overall PC marketplace, but in an analyst earnings call yesterday Huang uttered words that might some may find surprising coming from a major PC component supplier: ""A great tablet is better than a cheap PC."" That's a troubling statement when you consider that the average selling price of a Windows laptop in the U.S. traditionally floats between $500 and $600, or about the cost of a typical 10-inch tablet. Digging a little deeper into Nvidia's third quarter numbers sheds some light on Huang's statement as well as the company's plans for the future, however. Despite the stagnant, sluggish state of the overall PC market, Nvidia actually managed to beat analyst expectations for the period, selling $1.2 billion in total and earning $209.1 million in income, enabling the company to pay out a stock payer dividend for the first time ever. Discrete graphic card sales accounted for 70 percent of Nvidia's revenues, but what put the company over the top were sales of its quad-core Tegra 3 mobile processor -- the very CPU found in those ""great tablets."" Discrete graphics, on the other hand, are very rarely found in cheap laptops and desktops. Tegra 3 processors can be found in a wide variety of Android phones and tablets as well as Windows RT-powered slates, and Nvidia is working hard at creating a next-gen chip that integrates 4G LTE capabilities into the central processor. The Tegra 3's integrated graphics certainly open up better gaming possibilities than you can find in a cheap PC, but even budget PCs sport multitasking and other productivity-friendly features missing from most slates.

2013-05-14,nVidia Shield is most expensive portable gaming gadget on market,"After flaunting its new Android-based gaming handheld at this year’s CES, Nvidia has finally decided to announce how much its Shield device will cost and when it will be available. Formerly known as Project Shield, the portable gaming gadget will sell for a relatively steep $349 via retailers such as GameStop, Micro Center and Canada Computers. The device ships in June, and pre-orders begin on May 20. Shield comes equipped with a 5-inch 720p touch screen attached to a console-grade controller, integrated speakers, 16GB of memory, Bluetooth 3.0 and support for Wi-Fi 802.11 2X2. It’s powered by Nvidia’s new flagship Tegra 4 processor and runs both pure Android and Nvidia’s own entertainment-centric interface. MORE: 12 Killer PlayStation 4 Games and Demos The company has also unveiled the first five games that will be available at launch, which include action adventure game “Broken Age,” role playing game “Costume Quest,” alien shooter “Flyhunter: Origins,” action sports title “Skiing Fred,” and 3-D puzzle “Chuck’s Challenge.” Since it runs on Android, Shield is compatible with any titles in the Google Play Store. The device is also compatible with the Steam service. GeForce game streaming will be launching as a beta feature when the device hits stores in June, which means that you’ll be able to access any games from your Nvidia GeForce GTX GPU-powered computer via Shield. With a price of $349, the Shield costs $100 more than the PS Vita and $180 more than the Nintendo 3DS. You can also pick up an Xbox 360 with a Kinect Bundle for the same price as the Shield. It will be up to Nvidia to prove that it’s mighty mini console is worth the splurge.",FoxNews
2017-01-06,"The 10 best laptops, drones, and other gadgets from CES 2017","Here are 10 of the biggest standouts at CES 2017, from a $9,000 curved screen gaming laptop to an underwater drone for “immersive” fishing. Acer Predator 21 X giant gaming laptop: This massive gaming laptop with a 21-inch display packs all of the fastest Intel and Nvidia silicon you can shake a joystick at into a luggable design. It uses eye-tracking technology to, for example, allow gamers to identify enemies and “take cover simply by gazing at objects on the screen.” The Predator 21 X will be available in North America in February with prices starting at $8,999. Triple-display gaming laptop: But wait— Razer is upping the ante with the “world’s first” automated triple display laptop. The luggable laptop from Razer (known for thin and light gaming laptops) manages to fit three 17.3-inch 4K screens into one integrated piece of hardware. The graphics are powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. Pricing has not been announced. Underwater drone: Get a drone assist for fishing – an underwater drone in this case. The PowerRay robot can dive as deep as 98 feet underwater, and images and data can be sent up to 262 feet. It even includes an internal fish-luring light. Using an app, you can view real-time photos or video. Preorders start on February 27, 2017. No pricing yet. How thin can a TV get? LG's new 77-inch OLED TV is preposterously thin at 3.85mm, including wall mount (the panel itself is 2.57mm thick). But it’s not just the thinness that will grab you. It comes with “Active HDR” – which analyzes and optimizes content scene-by-scene for the best image possible – and 4K resolution. The W7 will ship this March, with preorders starting soon. No pricing yet, but you can bet it’s going to be expensive. (Note that Sony also showed off an OLED TV this week with audio that is delivered via vibrations in the display itself.) Dell’s first 8K display: With four times the pixels of 4K, it’s Dell’s first 8K monitor. That matters because Dell is one of the top computer display brands on the planet. The pricing for the Dell UltraSharp 32 (32-inch) Ultra HD 8K Monitor starts at $4,999 and it will be available March 23 on Dell.com. A modular drone that can become whatever you want. With the tagline “Build it. Code it. Fly it.” the Airblock drone is made of magnetic, modular parts for easy assembly and disassembly. “It does stunts through drag-and-drop programming,” according to Makeblock, the Chinese startup behind the kickstarter project. Newest Windows 10 virtual reality (VR) headsets from HP, Dell, Acer: Microsoft gave conference-goers a glance at upcoming Windows VR headsets from HP, Dell and Acer at CES this week. Details are scant right now, but look for the cheapest priced at around $300, according to Engadget.

2012-04-24,"AMD Announces Radeon 7000M Series GPUs: More Power, Less Juice","AMD doesn't want to get left out in the cold. On the heels of Intel's Ivy Bridge and Nvidia's Kepler chip platform announcements, AMD released the details of its London series of GPUs, which it says will provide increased performance and greater power efficiency. There are six GPU series in all. The first three--Radeon HD 7450 (""Seymour'), Radeon HD 7500M (""Thames 64b""), and Radeon HD 7600M (""Thames 128b"") are all based on the company's current 40nm process, and are currently on the market. The other three--Radeon HD 7700M (""Chelsea""), 7800M (""Heathrow'), and 7900M (""Wimbledon"") GPUs will use AMD's new 28nm GCN (Graphics Core Next) architecture, and will come out in May or June. Some of the new features of the 7000 series include a new instruction set architecture, a 9th-generation tessellator, support for PCI Express 3.0, OpenCL, DirectCompute 11, and is designed for DirectX 11. AMD has also built in a number of power-saving features into the new GPUs. Enduro technology switches automatically between integrated and discrete GPUs based on the app, as well as if the notebook is plugged in. Power Gating--which is only available with the 7700M and 7800M GPUS--shuts down portions of the GPU when not in use. ZeroCore shuts down the GPU when idling--which AMD says results in a better than 86-percent power reduction--and is also used to control additional GPUs in CrossFire. In terms of performance, AMD says that the 7970M GPU will provide up to 1.5 times the performance of its previous generation graphics on titles such as ""Batman: Arkham City,"" as well as benchmarks such as 3DMark Vantage. So far, one system has been announced that will use the 7970M GPU: The Alienware M17x. Here's a quick rundown of the specs of the higher-end GPUs:",FoxNews
2013-08-09,Nvidia Shield review,"Nvidia, which creates processors for computers and game consoles, has always been a big player in gaming, but it never had a gaming device of its own. Now it does: the Nvidia Shield. This handheld Android gaming device, available for $300, is a great product, although it may appeal mainly to Android gamers. The Shield is meant for gaming, but it also has tablet-like qualities. This review focuses primarily on the gaming aspects of the Shield. We're also testing it as a tablet, and we'll update this review with those results soon. The Shield has a clamshell design, which protects its 5-inch capacitive multi-touch screen when it isn’t in use [edited 8/13/13]. When opened, the screen sits atop a very traditional game controller, complete with a directional pad, two thumbsticks, four face buttons, and shoulder and trigger buttons on the back of the device. In addition, there are Volume Control, Home, Start, and Back buttons, and an Nvidia button that takes you directly to the Shield games menu and doubles as a power button. The Shield has two speakers built into its face, and the sound performance is good, especially for a handheld device (though you’ll still get better sound out of a good pair of headphones). The face plate of the Shield, called a Tag, is also interchangeable. You can buy one for 20 bucks if you want to add a little personal flair to your device. The Shield’s connections include a Mini-HDMI output, Micro-USB 2.0, MicroSD storage slot, and a headphone jack with microphone support. The Shield does a lot of things well. The controls are very responsive and perform just as well as they do on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. My only gripe is that the thumbsticks are a bit close together, and the device is bulky—so those with smaller hands may find it a little uncomfortable. The controls can also be used to navigate the Shield’s home screen and menus fairly intuitively. The available games vary in quality. You can buy and play anything that's sold in the Google Play Store, but some games are optimized for Shield. Real Boxing, for example, has very impressive visuals and is easily controlled using the Shield's game pad; and you won't have to change any settings. Another promising feature: The Shield can stream games from a PC, so your PC games become more portable. The feature is in beta right now, so only a limited number of games are available. (We don’t yet have a desktop with the required specs to use this streaming feature, so we can’t comment on it.) You can also use the Shield to play games on your TV wirelessly using Miracast (if your TV is compatible) or via the Shield’s mini HDMI port (cable not included). And since you can access the Google Play Store directly, you can download any games or apps that you’ve previously purchased without having to re-buy them. You also have access to a huge selection of nongaming-related apps, which makes the Shield versatile. For more gaming tips and reviews, visit our guide to video games, consoles, and tech toys. The Shield’s main flaw is that it's awkward to use the touch controls without putting it down. And it makes sense only to use it in landscape mode: In portrait mode, you'd have to lay it awkwardly on its side. The Shield is also a bit heavier than I prefer for a handheld game device. Holding 20.4 ounces could become exhausting after extended periods of game play. And finally, since the Shield’s PC-sreaming feature is only in beta, it will work only with desktop computers that have a GeForce GTX 650 or higher GPU. The Shield gets a lot more right than it does wrong—but it's a niche device. Hardcore gamers will likely opt for cheaper portable game consoles that are supported by the big gaming companies, such as the PlayStation Vita or Nintendo 3DS. Casual gamers would be better off going for a cheaper device with a larger screen, such as a Samsung Tab or Google Nexus tablet, or even a smart phone. Hardcore gamers who specifically enjoy the Android OS are likely to be the buyers for the Shield. It may be a good choice for those who play a lot of PC games and would like to make them a little more portable, too, though that feature is still in its early stages. That said, the Shield may just be a little ahead of its time. The Android platform seems poised to become a force in gaming, with quite a few consoles and handhelds being released this year. The problem is that there aren’t enough of the hugely popular games in Android that could get hardcore gamers to make the switch. It will take more high-quality and big-name titles to make their way to Android for these devices to gain a foothold in the market. —Matt Ferretti Copyright © 2005-2013 Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.

2015-07-02,Nvidia rumored to be at work on GTX 950 Ti priced around $150,"Nvidia's relatively recent release of the GTX 980 Ti was well timed, as it helped it maintain its performance crown even after AMD released its Fury X video card. With that in mind, there's some credibility to the rumors that it's now working on a GTX 950 Ti in the hopes that it can capture more of the mid-range market, taking the fight to cards like the Radeon R7 370. The new card is said to similar architecturally to the GTX 960, featuring a cut down version of the GM206-300 GPU core, known as the GM206-250. TechSpot speculates that this will leave it with less than the 960's 1024 CUDA cores and a price tag around the $150 mark. If that is indeed what a 950 Ti would cost, it would make it dollar for dollar competitive with the R9 370 and would also see the GTX 750 Ti finally replaced, as it currently retails for just shy of that amount. Although AMD has traditionally held firm in the sub-$200 range, Nvidia can afford to target its opponent's homeland these days, as it's far ahead in the overall performance game. While the latest batch of AMD's Fury GPUs might provide some top end competition in specific scenarios, for the most part it feels like some iteration of the new HBM sporting cards will be required before their potential is fully unlocked. Indeed, if Nvidia is looking to refresh its budget and mid-range offerings to make them more attractive to prospective buyers, all it would need to do is announce that its cards are new and not a rebranded GPU from up to four years past. That's quite a selling point these days.",FoxNews
2023-08-31,US denies blocking chip sales to Middle East,"The Biden administration ""has not blocked chip sales to the Middle East,"" a U.S. Department of Commerce spokesperson said on Thursday, after disclosures that Washington had expanded export license requirements for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices artificial-intelligence chips. Nvidia revealed the new rules in a regulatory filing earlier this week. A person familiar with the matter confirmed on Wednesday that AMD is affected by the change. The Commerce Department declined to comment on whether it had imposed new requirements on specific U.S. companies. Neither Nvidia nor AMD immediately returned requests for comment on Thursday. The new rules would require Nvidia to seek licenses before selling its flagship chips to some Middle Eastern countries, the filing said. Neither Nvidia nor AMD have disclosed whether they have applied for such licenses and whether they have been approved or denied. U.S. officials usually impose export controls for national security reasons. A similar move announced last year signaled an escalation of the U.S. crackdown on China's technological capabilities, but it was not immediately clear what risks were posed by exports to the Middle East. Many of the U.S. curbs on technology exports to China amount to a blanket denial of all licenses.",FoxNews
2007-05-18,Review: Dull-Looking Toshiba Laptop Is Secret Game Monster,"Toshiba's out to prove that you don't need glitz, glowing innards, or Falcon or Alien designs to make a powerful gaming machine. The latest addition to the gaming line Toshiba launched last year, the Toshiba Satellite P100-ST9772 ($2,899 direct) is aimed at hard-core gamers who don't fancy the flashy paint jobs or high-end labels and are more concerned about what's inside. Despite its low-profile design, this machine lets gamers reap the benefits of an nVidia GeForce Go 7900 GTX, a 2-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 processor and Windows Vista Ultimate. • Click here for FOXNews.com's Personal Technology Center. • Click here to visit FOXNews.com's Video Gaming Center. At first glance, the P100-ST9772 doesn't strike you as a gaming laptop. The design is no different than those of Toshiba's other consumer-grade laptops, such as the Satellite A135-S4467, which costs under a thousand dollars. Don't expect any fancy paint jobs or custom tattoos, as on the Voodoo Envy u:909, or the unique strobe lights built into the Dell XPS M1710 (Core 2 Duo). The P100-ST9772 is as subtle as it gets for a gaming laptop. Its onyx-blue metallic lid is featured in other nongaming Satellite systems as well. Onyx, a quartz-like rock, bears some resemblance to the metallic finish on the lid, but rarely does it come in navy blue. Despite the P100-ST9772's no-thrills design, its components may intrigue gamers. The 17-inch widescreen is absolutely gorgeous. It doesn't have the 1,920-by-1,200 resolution found on the XPS M1710 (Core 2 Duo), but its 1,680-by-1,050 resolution is nothing to laugh about. The transflective screen's surface resembles a television screen, producing brilliant colors that serve other aspects of multimedia besides gaming, including digital photography, video editing and movie watching. The keyboard is tactile, as is the case with most Toshiba keyboards. Adjacent to it is a numeric keypad, handy for typing in those pesky gaming serial numbers. Adding a number pad constricts the direction keys to half their size, so gamers who use these keys to move might find this a little annoying. Aside from navigation, the touchpad has another purpose: If you tap it lightly, several icons within the touchpad light up to serve as application shortcuts. Gaming is the P100-ST9772's first agenda, but its media features are well worth noting. It comes with a DVI-D port, so you can take your gaming experience — digitally — onto a larger display. Of course, you also have analog video-out from your S-Video and VGA-out ports. The four USB ports aren't as impressive as the XPS M1710's six. I think this system would have made a serious bid for Editors' Choice had Toshiba included an HD DVD drive in the $2,899 price tag. It doesn't have an HD drive as an option, either, unlike the Dell XPS M1710 with its Blu-ray drive. Everything is neatly tied together by Windows Vista Ultimate. The media center aspect of Vista really brings the 17-inch screen to life. You won't see any lag in Vista given the nature of this system's components. Along with a powerful dual-core processor (the 2-GHz Core 2 Duo T7200), you have 2GB of RAM to offset Vista Ultimate's hefty requirements as well as deliver excellent Photoshop scores. It's safe to say that the components aren't as fast as the ones found in the Dell XPS M1710 (Blu-ray). Both the 2.33-GHz M1710's Core 2 Duo T7600 CPU and its nVidia GeForce Go 7950 GTX graphics chipset are a step above those of the P100-ST9772. That's not to say that the P100-ST9772 can't hold its own. It obliterates the GeForce Go 7600 found on the MSI Q677 Crystal Edition, and its gaming scores are at least four times as fast. Today's popular games will run exceptionally well with the P105-ST9772's components. Its nVidia GeForce Go 7900 GTX won't give you bragging rights above the Dell, but it furnished excellent 3Dmark 2006, ""Prey"" and ""Company of Heroes"" 3D gaming scores. In fact, a big chunk of that $2,899 price tag is set aside for the graphics card. Battery life, as expected, isn't worth writing home about, running down on a DVD in 1 hour 39 minutes. If you configure both the Toshiba Satellite P100-ST9772 and the gaudier Dell XPS M1710 with similar components, the P100-ST9772 is actually about $200 cheaper. At the end of the day, gaming is not about impressing your friends with fancy paint jobs or the fastest components. It's about winning as many virtual death matches as you can, and the P100-ST9772 is up to the task. BOTTOM LINE: The dull looks might not impress you, but the Toshiba Satellite P100-ST9772 is a hard-core gaming laptop that churns out excellent frame rates. PROS: Excellent gaming scores. Relatively light gaming laptop. Gorgeous 17-inch widescreen. DVI-D out. CONS: Dull design. Should offer a standard HD DVD drive with the price or at least as an option.

2012-03-07,"Audi Connect at CeBIT: Infotainment, MMI Touch in the Audi A3 Quattro","This is Audi's first CeBIT with an exhibition booth of its own, and the German automaker made quite a statement with all that dedicated space. Under a mirrored ceiling decked out with LEDs, visitors can fest their eyes on the Audi A7 Quattro and the A3 Quattro, the later of which was unveiled this week at the show. Though the black and red exteriors, respectively, are none too shabby, it's unsurprisingly all about the interior at Audi's CeBIT display. And inside the brand-new A3 you'll find plenty of tech, from a touchpad situated front and center to a system for drawing letters with your finger to input destinations for the Google-powered navigation services. On the infotainment side, there's a generous suite of media and social-media apps: Facebook and Twitter are here, along with Music and Radio. Audi calls this in-car technology MMI Touch, and it comes to you via Nvidia Tegra power. The connectivity cherry on top? 4G/LTE. Take a look below.",FoxNews
2012-04-10,Toshiba Launches Excite 7.7 Tablet with AMOLED Screen for $499,"It looks like those shoppers who have been clamoring for a Galaxy Tab 7.7 without a carrier contract finally have a good alternative. The Toshiba Excite 7.7 is the first Wi-Fi only Android Tablet to sport an AMOLED screen, and this 7.7-inch panel was a beautiful sight during our hands-on time. Toshiba is targeting this Ice Cream Sandwich slate at gamers, and it certainly has the graphics chops to handle the latest titles, thanks to Nvidia's Tegra 3 processor. The Excite 7.7 is very portable at just 13.4 ounces, and it measures a mere .3 inches thin. And yet Toshiba found room for a micro USB port and microSD card for expansion. In addition to Google Play and other Google apps, the Excite 7.7 comes with Toshiba Book Place for access to more than 3 million books, Toshiba Media Player, a file manager, Netflix and Zinio. The biggest drawback to the Excite 7.7 is the price. At $499 for 16GB and $579 for 32GB, this tablet costs $300 more than the Amazon Kindle Fire. The Galaxy Tab 7.7 also costs $499, but you have to spend at least $30 per month for a data plan.",FoxNews
2012-07-19,Audi Bringing In-Car Wi-Fi to 2013 A4 and A5 Model Lines,"Audi announced today that its 2013 A4 and A5 model lines will be getting a lot smarter thanks to the inclusion of the German automaker's Audi Connect technology suite, an addition to Audi's existing MMI Navigation Plus infotainment and telematics system. The standard MMI Navigation Plus system includes an LCD display, MMI control logic (a touchpad with handwriting recognition), a 40GB hard drive and is powered by an Nvidia Tegra processor. So what does Audi Connect bring to the tablet? A whole lot actually. The system, which we went hands-on with at the New York International Auto Show back in April, adds 3G data connectivity to your vehicle via a T-Mobile SIM card made specifically for Audi. With that kind of connectivity, users can turn their Audis into mobile 3G hotspots for up to 8 devices. In addition to its hotspot functionality, Audi Connect also brings Google Maps and Earth integration, Google Voice Local Search and Internet radio. The cost for all of this connected goodness? Roughly $25-$30 per month. Audi Connect will be available on the Audi A4 and A5, as well as their high-powered variants, the S4 and S5. Pricing for the A4 and A5 starts at $32,500 and $37,800 respectively. The S4 and S5 will cost you a bit more, starting at $47,600 and $50,900 respectively.",FoxNews
2012-03-01,Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 with SRS Audio Runs Modern Combat 3 on Tablets,"Qualcomm, like Nvidia with the Tegra 3, was demoing the power of its quad-core chip, the Snapdragon S4, at Mobile World Congress this week. And while the CPU manufacturer was quick to point out that four cores are not necessarily than two, it did show how all those cores can enhance mobile gameplay in graphically intense titles, such as Modern Combat 3, as seen in the demo below. The S4 was running the multiplayer on some reference design tablets, and Qualcomm had the action displayed on a big screen to showcase its chip's graphics power. But it wasn't just crisp visuals and fast frame rates; SRS audio technology built directly onto the S4 chip provides a sound boost that you can hopefully hear above the din of booth visitors in the background.",FoxNews
2012-06-06,"Acer Shows Off Iconia Tab A110, Sub-$200 Quad-Core Tablet","At this year's Computex trade show in Taipei, amidst little fanfare, Acer took the wraps off a sub-$200 quad-core Ice Cream Sandwich tablet -- the Iconia Tab A110. At first glance, this may not seem like significant news. The Iconia Tab A110 is 7 inches, runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (uncustomized) and is powered by an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor -- on the whole, some rather unexciting specs. But speaking to The Verge, an Acer representative said the A110 would be asserted as the manufacturer's primary low-end device in Q3 2012, and that it would be available then for less than $200. Previously, Nvidia had floated around the idea of sub-$200 quad-core tablets and dubbed the strategy ""Project Kai,"" but hadn't come out with any more news beyond that. Then a recent rumor mused that the Asus Nexus Tablet (which hasn't been confirmed thus far) might be the first tablet to sport four cores at this price point, and would perhaps be unveiled at Google I/O. Now, it seems Acer has jumped the gun on both these endeavors with the unveiling of the Iconia A110. The rest of the Iconia A110's specs are humdrum, including 1GB of RAM, 1024 x 600 resolution, 8GB of internal storage (expandable via microSD), a front-facing camera (only), HDMI output and dual-display support. Plus, it's a little thick at 11.4mm, with rather narrow viewing angles. But if you're a budget-conscious, power-hungry goon who thinks doubling processing capacity is worth sacrificing other features, you may want to consider the Iconia A110. via The VergeImage via The Verge",FoxNews
2012-06-06,"ASUS Tablet 600 Hands-On: Speedy Windows 8 RT, Incredible Endurance","On Monday, ASUS unveiled its Tablet 600, the first official Windows 8 tablet powered by Nvidia's Tegra 3, quad-core CPU. Unfortunately at ASUS's event, we were only able to photograph the slate and keyboard combo device from a distance and nobody was there to demonstrate all its capabilities. However, today, Nvidia showed off the Tablet 600's key strengths and its ability to run Windows 8 RT, the ARM version of Windows 8, with great aplomb. In a brief demo, an Nvidia rep showed us how quickly the Tablet 600 can move through menus and launch apps in Windows 8 RT. He also showed the benefits of docking two apps next to each other when he placed a weather report and a photo side-by-side. He was unable to get Internet access working on the Tablet 600 so we didn't experience web surfing or the Internet-driven news app, but clearly the device is capable of performing those tasks easily. Right now, Windows RT is only capable of running Metro apps and the current build preview does not include Microsoft Office, which will come standard with the final build of the operating system (Windows RT only). The real test of the Tablet 600 and its Tegra 3 CPU's performance will come when you can run games or compute-intensive tasks like video editing on it. No doubt that time is coming soon and Nvidia told us that it is actively working with software publishers to port their games and other advanced apps over to Windows RT. Our rep confirmed that there will be a Windows 8 version of the popular Tegra Zone app store of Tegra-optimized software,though it will run as a section of the general Microsoft app store. We also expect the Tablet 600 to have epic battery life as Nvidia said that the slate itself will last through over 10 hours of HD video playback and that number will rise to 18+ hours with the keyboard dock attached. Overall, we were struck by the beauty of the Tablet 600's 600-nit screen which, even though it is only 1366 x 768 resolution, looked really sharp. When we looked at photos of flowers and other colorful subjects, the images popped as much as if we were viewing them on a a gorgeous AMOLED phone screen. We were also impressed by the way that the Tablet 600 blends together so seamlessly with its keyboard dock. Because the snap-in hinge is actually below the deck, the tablet looks more like a notebook than a slate that's just been slapped onto a dock. The raven black color reminded us more of an HP netbook than an ASUS tablet, which is a nice departure from all the champagne-colored ASUS tablets we've seen lately. We were also pleased to see that theh Tablet 600 has a USB port on the side of its dock. That means it can connect with just about any Windows peripheral you throw at it, from a printer to a barcode reader, because all the common drivers are the same between Windows 8 RT and Windows 8 for x86 processors. We look forward to really putting the ASUS Tablet 600 through its paces sometime closer to its launch. In the meantime, check out the photos and video to get a closer look.",FoxNews
2012-02-27,"Toshiba 7.7-inch Tegra 3 Tablet Appears, Slashes Zombies in Vibrant AMOLED Color","Toshiba has yet to announce that it's coming out with a 7,7-inch, quad-core Tegra 3 tablet, but that didn't stop the company from displaying a very intriguing demo unit at Nvidia's Mobile World Congress booth. We had the opportunity to hands-on with as-yet unnamed Android 4.0 slate and came away impressed with its brilliant 1280 x 800 AMOLED display, superthin design, and ability to play high-res games with great aplomb. As we approached its display table, the first thing we noticed about the Toshiba 7.7-inch Tegra 3 tablet was just how vibrant the default Ice Cream Sandwich wallpaper with its multicolored stripes appeared. Because the display is only 7.7-inches, the 1280 x 800 pixels give it a 196 PPI, much sharper than the 150.4 PPI that 10-inch competitors with the same resolution offer. The glossy glass on top of the panel helped the colors pop, but also produced some serious glare, forcing us to move the tablet around a lot while filming to avoid getting light spots in our footage. The Toshiba 7.7-inch tablet's design aesthetic is nothing like those of its bulky Thrive line. The device has rounded edges, a super glossy screen, and chrome accents that reminded us of the Pantech Element. A silver textured back could looked more like an Acer or ASUS aesthetic. Perhaps the most startling difference between this device and the Thrive 7 is its thinness. Where both the Thrive 7-inch and original 10-inch Thrive were heavy and chunky, this new design is extremely light. Exact weight and measurements were not available. With its quad-core Tegra 3 CPU, the Toshiba 7.7-inch tablet is a lot more than a pretty face. The demo unit had a recent beta version of Bladeslinger, an upcoming first-person action game where you control a cowboy who has to fight a hoard of deadly zombies, usually with knives. Images of the cowboy, the environment around him, and the zombies were crisp and highly-detailed. There's no word yet on pricing, availability, or even a name for this Toshiba 7.7-inch tablet, but we really like what we've seen and hope to see this product in a final form.",FoxNews
2012-03-19,Tablet Chip Showdown: Nvidia Tegra 3 vs. the New iPad's A5X,"When Apple announced the new iPad earlier this month, CEO Tim Cook claimed that the new iPad's new A5X chip offers four times the performance of Nvidia's quad-core Tegra 3 CPU. Now that the new iPad has hit the street, we've been able to compare its performance to that of an ASUS Eee Pad Transformer Prime, the first tablet with a Tegra 3 inside. The results may surprise you. GLBenchmark 2.1 In GLBenchmark 2.1, one of the few benchmarks that has versions for both Android and iOS, the new iPad scored higher. On the program's Egypt Standard test, which shows a 3D animation of ancient Egypt, the new iPad and its A5X chip processed 6718 frames at a rate of 60 frames-per-second to the Transformer Primer's 5,939 frames at 53 fps. When GLBenchmark ran the Geometric test (vertex weighted), which measures low-level shader performance, the new iPad processed 7,530,524 frames at a rate of 57 fps while the Tegra 3-based Transformer Prime processed just 3,523,926 at a rate of 27 fps. We saw the same trend on the program's Fill test, which measures texturing speed, as the iPad processed 1.98 billion textels per second to the Prime's 404.61 million. Geekbench On Geekbench, a cross-platform benchmark that measures raw processing power rather than graphics, the quad-core Tegra 3 blew its competitor way as it achieved an overall score of 1,571 to the A5X's 692. On the integer (1391 to 614), floating point (2408 to 825) and memory subtests (1076 to 784) , the Tegra 3 dominated, but the A5X bested it by a small margin of 324 to 266 on the stream subtest. Browser Benchmarks: Peacekeeper and Sunspider We also tested the new iPad's Safari browser performance on two synthetic benchmarks and compared the results to those on the Transformer Prime's stock Android browser. In Peacekeeper, a general-purpose browser benchmark, the two tablets got nearly identical scores of 386 for the iPad and 387 for the Prime. However, the iPad completed the Sunspider JavaScript rendering test in just 1810 milliseconds to the Prime's 2216 ms. Unfortunately, since the two tablets use two different browsers, it's impossible to isolate the processor's role in giving the iPad slightly faster Sunspider results. It's quite possible that Safari just performs better on this test than the Android 4.0 browser does. Subjective Gaming Performance Evaluating gaming performance on any tablet is a mainly subjective task, because there's no benchmark that measures framerates like FRAPs does in Windows. However, we attempted to see what the differences in appearance were when we played the same game on both devices and placed them side by side. When we fired up the jet ski racing game Riptide GP on both devices, we noticed immediately that images looked sharper and more colorful on the new iPad's retina display. Edges of objects like our avatar's ski jacket, the walls on the racing course, and the writing on the scoreboard looked so much crisper on the iPad's 2048 x 1536 screen and colors just popped a lot more than on the Transformer's 1280 x 800 display. The difference in screen quality was only a little less pronounced when we played the third-person shooter game Shadowgun. However, when we looked past the beautiful screen, we noticed that the version of the game playing on the Transformer Prime had some additional visual effects that were not present on the new iPad. In Riptide, we noticed more reflections in the water and a splashing effect that made it look like water was hitting the screen when our ski landed from a jump. On the iPad, we just saw a little foam appear on landing, not splashes. In Shadowgun, we walked into a scene with a burning helicopter and, on both devices, saw gorgeous billows of smoke and fire rising up to the sky. However, only on the Tegra 3-powered Transformer Prime, did the game show two flags billowing in the wind; the flags weren't even there on the iPad version. Our experience playing Shadowgun and Riptide on the two tablets shows how difficult it is to separate processor performance from other system components like the screen. It's likely that, if we could put a gorgeous 2048 x 1536 screen on the Transformer Prime, these games would have both the great special effects and the sharp, beautiful images. However, comparing tablet-to-tablet rather than chip-to-chip, the iPad's screen makes the gaming experience a much tastier visual feast than you get on the Transformer Prime. We hope that upcoming higher-res Android tablets like the 1920 x 1200 screened Transformer Prime TF701 will give mobile gamers the perfect combination of special effects and sharp, vibrant images. It is also possible that, once developers rework their games for the new iPad's A5X chip, we'll see the same kind of added special effects that we see with Tegra 3. Neither Shadowgun nor Riptide has yet been optimized for the A5X chip, so who knows what they will look like in their next iOS iterations. For now, its clear that the A5X offers better benchmark performance, while Tegra 3-optimized games offer more and better visual effects.",FoxNews
2015-07-27,Nvidia's upcoming GTX 950 may have sprung a leak,"The battle for prominence in this generation of graphics cards from both of the big manufacturers has been an interesting one. While Nvidia has retained the performance crown, AMD certainly stole the show with its very different take on a contemporary graphics card, the liquid-cooled Fury X. However, while hearts and minds might be won with high-end hardware, the mid-range and economy class cards are the real money makers, so Nvidia's GTX 950 is one of its most important releases this year. Although we don't have anything in the way of official specifications, we do have some rumored ones that are said to have leaked . It is said to be based on the same GM206 silicon as the GTX 960, but will come with a quarter less CUDA cores enabled, which work out to 768. Clock speeds are expected to be somewhere between 1,150 and 1,250 MHz on the core, boosted to somewhere between 1,350 and 1,450MHz. Memory wise it's expected there will be just 2GB of GDDR5 running through a 128-bit bus. To power this users will require just one eight-pin PCIe power cable and must factor in around a 90 watts power draw at load. In terms of its rear port connectors, it's slated to come with dual link DVI, a single HDMI 2.0 port and at least one DisplayPort 1.2 connector, though there may be more. Third-party vendors tend to customize port selection, as well, so you'll likely be able to find a GTX 95o with whatever combination you desire. All of this is designed to give Nvidia a viable replacement for its popular GTX 750 and a decent competitor for AMD's R7 370, which is actually a rebrand of AMD's previous R9 270 GPU released towards the tail end of 2013. As much as these specifications should all be taken with a pinch of salt, we won't have long to wait to find out for sure what the GTX 950 is all about, as it is expected to launch on August 17.",FoxNews
2013-01-07,Nvidia Wows CES with Project Shield Android and PC Gaming Console,"The Nvidia Shield is easily one of the most exciting gadgets of CES 2013, combining Android with a Tegra 4 processor inside a 5-inch portable gaming console. The device offers console-grade controllers, easy access to Tegra Zone for playing mobile games, plus the ability to stream the latest PC games. Although Nvidia experienced a few hiccups getting up and running, the Shield successfully streamed Need for Speed from a PC to a 4K television, delivering an awesome amount of eye candy. (You'll need a PC with the latest Nvidia GPU.) Nvidia also says you'll be able to access nearly 2,000 games via Valve's Steam service, including Assassin's Creed III. The Nvidia Shield sports a 5-inch HD display and a first-of-its-kind bass reflex audio system that promises to outperform the latest HP Beats Audio laptop. You should expect 5 to 10 hours of gameplay along with up to 24 hours of HD video playback. Connectivity options include HDMI, microUSB, and microSD. Plus, you can purchase customizable tags or shield for the lid of the device. When you press the shield button you enter a Game mode, with plenty of high-quality titles available, from Hawken (supporting the Unreal 3 engine) to Real Boxing.

2012-05-25,Report: Google and ASUS To Unveil Nexus Tablet at Google I/O,"If you're desperately wondering about what's in store for the imminent Google I/O conference, here are some reports to satiate your curiosity. Yesterday, DigiTimes published a rumor that a collaboration by Google and ASUS would produce an official Nexus tablet, slated to start shipping in June for $149 and today, Techno Buffalo endorsed those claims with a report of their own, adding that one of their ""trusted sources"" informed them that Google would be taking the wraps off this Nexus tablet at Google I/O. That's not to say, however, that the two reports aren't at odds with one another in some aspects. First, Techno Buffalo makes the completely independent claim that the Nexus tablet will based on NVIDIA's ""Project Kai"" tablet strategy -- which, in case you've forgotten, involved the goal of developing a sub-$200 tablet sporting NVIDIA's quad-core Tegra 3 chip. Techno Buffalo says that since their source confirmed the inclusion of this chip in the tablet, it's likely that it will carry a $199 price tag, also corroborating previous rumors. (DigiTimes says the device will cost $149.) Furthermore, the outlet is reporting that the Nexus tablet will come preloaded with Android 5.0 ""Jelly Bean"" preinstalled, according to their sources. We'd take this last detail with caution, especially given that most Android devices have yet to receive the Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 update. Either way Google I/O is just a month away, so we'll find out soon which of these reports will hold up as truth. But as we wait, the churning rumor mill is an altogether welcome distraction to tide us over until such time that the official conference date comes to pass. via DigiTimes and Techno BuffaloImage via Techno Buffalo",FoxNews
2010-01-14,"Among Technophiles, Tesla In and Edison Out","Decades after he died penniless, Nikola Tesla is elbowing aside his old adversary Thomas Edison in the pantheon of geek gods. When California engineers wanted to brand their new $100,000 electric sports car, one name stood out: Tesla. When circuit designers at microchip producer Nvidia Corp. in 2007 launched a new line of advanced processors, they called them Tesla. And when videogame writers at Capcom Entertainment in Silicon Valley needed a character who could understand alien spaceships for their new Dark Void saga, they found him in Nikola Tesla. Tesla was a scientist and inventor who achieved fame and fortune in the 1880s for figuring out how to make alternating current work on a grand scale, electrifying the world. He created the first major hydroelectric dam, at Niagara Falls. He thrilled packed theaters with presentations in which he ran high voltage through his body to illuminate a fluorescent light in his hand. His inventions helped Guglielmo Marconi develop radio. And his rivalry with Edison—called the Battle of the Currents because Edison had bet on direct current—was legendary. Tesla won the contest, when his AC equipment powered an unprecedented display of electric light at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Fifty years later, the 86-year-old Serbian emigré died in obscurity at a New York hotel, unmarried, childless and bereft of friends. Meanwhile, Edison was lionized for generations as one of America's greatest inventors. But Tesla has been rediscovered by technophiles, including Google Inc. co-founder Larry Page, who frequently cites him as an early inspiration. And Teslamania is going increasingly mainstream. An early hint was ""Tesla Girls,"" a 1984 single from the British technopop band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Performance artist Laurie Anderson has said she was fascinated by Tesla. David Bowie played a fictionalized version of him in the 2006 film ""The Prestige,"" alongside Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Director Terry Gilliam described Tesla in a recent documentary film as ""more of an artist than a scientist in some strange way."" Tesla, in short, is cool.

2013-01-09,Nvidia Project Shield In-Depth Preview: Mobile Gaming Evolved,"Based on how many people were gathered at Nvidia's booth to gawk at Project Shield--behind glass--it's safe to say that it's one of the most buzzed-about gadgets at CES 2013. Now that we've held the portable gaming console in our hands, we can say with confidence that it's worthy of the hype. The Shield is much more than a game controller with a sharp and vibrant 5-inch touch screen tacked on. It's a whole new way to experience high-octane Android games, as well as the latest titles streamed from your PC. Instead of futzing with touch controls, you can enjoy a lot more precision using the Shield's two analog sticks and multitude of buttons. While casual gamers might be scared off, this gadget isn't for the Angry Birds crowd. To be clear, the Shield is not a pocket-friendly device. This is something that gamers will throw in a bag and then whip out when they want to mow down some bad guys or bash a boxer's face in. At first we thought the analog controllers were packed too close together, but after a few seconds we had no problem moving and panning. What makes the Shield exciting to us is its versatility. It dowloads plays demanding 3D games downloaded from the Nvidia Tegra store, and it can stream the latest titles from your PC--but only if it has a recent model Nvidia GPU. For notebooks, we're talking about a GTX 660M, which are typically north of a grand. Streaming to a TV will be possible via Miracast technology, and Nvidia says that there should be several adapters on the market that deliver this AirPlay-like experience to multiple TV brands. Fuller integration of the technology into sets is a little ways off. During gameplay, Borderlands 2 streamed buttery smooth from a nearby desktop, but it was over an Ethernet connection. We'll have to see how well PC-to-Shield gameplay holds up over Wi-Fi. Overall, the Nvidia Shield is an exciting innovation not only because it demonstrates that Nvidia has serious hardware chops. Devices like this will finally spur Android game developers to give Google's platform the attention it deserves.",FoxNews
2012-06-04,Gigabyte U2442 Brings High-End Nvidia Graphics to the Ultrabook,"Ultrabooks with Intel's 3rd Generation Core Series processors may be good enough for productivity tasks, but we wouldn't recommend playing Batman: Arkham City on them. Fortunately, you don't have to choose between a thin-lightweight notebook and one with strong graphics performance. While it's not marketed as a gaming rig, the new Gigabyte u2442 14-inch Ultrabook comes with an optional Nvidia GT640M graphics chip, but weighs a reasonable 3.46 pounds while measuring just .7 inches thick. The notebook comes in three main configurations, the entry-level U2442C that has a 1366 x 768 display, integrated graphics and a 2.5-GHz Intel Core i5 CPU, the U2442V that uses a 1.9-GHz low-voltage Core i7 CPU with a 1600 x 900 display and integrated graphics, and the U2442N which has the 2.5-GHz Core i5 with a 1600 x 900 screen and the Nvidia GT640M chip. All versions have a wide selection of ports including full-size HDMI, Ethernet, SD card reader and USB 3.0 slots. We got a first glance at the U2442 at Cebit in March but today in Taipei we had a chance to take a somewhat more detailed look at the U2442V, which looks identical to the U2442N but doesn't have the same discrete graphics / CPU under the hood. We really liked the tron-esque blue keyboard backlight, the silver-colored chassis and the bright, colorful screen. We also loved the back area behind the hinge which houses two different vents, one each for the the CPU and the GPU. A Gigabyte rep says the vents help the notebook stay cool even under load. We're really looking forward to testing a U2442N in real-world scenarios where we can see how it plays HD video and games, but for now, it looks promising.

2012-12-06,Nvidia GeForce Experience Software Optimizes Your Game Settings,"Any serious player worth his XP knows that using a games' default settings is a recipe for poor performance. Developers simply don't have time to test every possible PC configuration so they go for the lowest common denominator in their factory settings, either providing worse image quality and special effects to make sure that the game is playable on lesser hardware or keeping the special effects on at the expense of smooth movement. Enter Nvidia GeForce Experience, a new application that reads your system hardware and recommends truly optimal settings for popular games, based on your computer's unique set of hardware. GeForce Experience leverages Nvidia's extensive database of game test data to ensure that you get every light effect, complex texture and physx effect your combination of CPU, video card and memory can provide while still giving you at least 40 frames per second. When you launch the software and select the game title you wish to optimize, GeForce Experience shows you a list of all your current settings and its list of recommendations. You can either accept all the recommendations and hit a button which will change them for you or tweak them yourself. The software also provides a brief explanation of each setting as you hover over it with your mouse. Considering that, even among hardcore gamers, few people know what obscure functions like Anisotropic texture filtering actually do, these definitions can be really helpful for users who want to experiment with the settings on their own. As part of its video card business, Nvidia does pre-release testing on most of the top titles before they come out and works closely with developers to make sure their games work well on a ton of different hardware configurations. To make GeForce Experience work, the company created a special team that takes the testing to another level, identifying target levels of graphics quality, developing special scripts to play through some of the most demanding areas and then feeding the games into huge server farms that use a complex algorithm to come up with recommendations. The client software accesses these servers every time it makes a recommendation. In a brief demo, Nvidia reps showed us the huge difference between default settings and GeForce Experience recommended settings in several demanding titles. In Borderlands 2 at default settings, stones on the ground were blurry and a pond was nothing more than a dry stone indentation, but with the recommendations, the ground had detailed textures and water flowed from the pond. In one of the Call of Duty games at dfeault settings, a street scene was dark with textures so blurry that the numbers on a wrist watch were illegible. With the GeForce Experience settings, colors were brighter, light reflected off of our gun scope and the numbers on the watch were sharp and clear. When our rep fired up Crysis 2, the default settings resulted in an unplayable framerate of just 20 fps and an image that took up only part of the screen. With the the GeForce Experience recomendations, the frame rate jumped to 40 fps while the quality of the images and special effects remained similar. GeForce Experience is entering private beta today, with 10,000 available tester spots and support for over 30 popular game titles, and a goal of reaching over 100 titles in the near future. In early 2013, Nvidia expects to launch the software as a free download for all users of recent Nvidia GPUs (Fermi and Kepler generation) on laptops or desktops.",FoxNews
2016-11-29,Navy gets new flight simulator technology,"The U.S. Navy’s latest flight simulator technology will be found among the exhibits at this year’s Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) taking place in Orlando this week, according to an announcement by NVIDIA. Together with virtual reality (VR) creator Mass Virtual, NVIDIA said the technology runs its Quadro graphics processing unit (GPU) and uses Mass Virtual’s Virtual Attain platform. The end result is a VR simulation that puts pilots in the cockpit of a F-18 fighter jet. Pilots are put through paces and have to determine whether or not an aggressor aircraft is nearby using sounds coming from the cockpit’s radar. NVIDIA wrote that virtual reality training provides soldiers with various realistic combat situations. NAVY REPORTEDLY BALKS AT $800k PROJECTILES FOR NEW WARSHIP Further, “one virtual reality station can train a soldier for multiple scenarios such as driving a tank, reacting under gun fire or reloading a rocket launcher,” wrote NVIDIA, adding that the use of virtual reality in training is highly efficient and cost effective for military organizations. John Brooks, CEO and founder of Mass Virtual said in a press release on NVIDIA’s website, “When you can achieve suspension of disbelief in a virtual environment, a user has much longer retention of what they’ve learned.”",FoxNews

2022-07-19,"CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC ignore Pelosi's husband buying over $1 million of computer chip stock ahead of vote","Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry but anyone who relied on CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS or NBC for information would have no idea. Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million shares of Nvidia, a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. However, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC failed to mention Paul Pelosi on the air from when it broke on July 15 through primetime on Monday, according to a search of transcripts conducted by Fox News Digital. Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was ""no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore"" the story that could damage Pelosi. ""For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. ""If this were Kevin McCarthy's wife, there'd be zero question as to whether ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, and NBC would be having full reports about it with snarky chyrons and commentaries from the Rachel Maddows and Don Lemons of the world,"" Houck continued. ""Same goes for the major newspapers. A-1 stories would be guaranteed. But because it involves Paul Pelosi, they'd rather play ball with their friends and avoid drawing the ire of the Speaker's office."" In 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. ""The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. FOX Business’ Charlie Gasparino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. ""This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,"" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. ""Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,"" he said. ""I don’t believe this hits the insider trading bar… a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn’t hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance on steroids."" Gasparino continued: ""He knows that he has an information edge. Not saying it’s illegal, but he knows he has an information edge. He and his wife talk about stuff… he knows what’s coming down the pike... It’s really disgusting looking."" Paul Pelosi, 82, has been married to Nancy Pelosi since 1963. Last month, he was charged with DUI with injury by the Napa County District Attorney's Office after he was involved in a crash on May 28.

2015-03-18,Elon Musk: Autonomous cars may lead to driving being outlawed,"Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk has come out and stated what many opponents of autonomous cars may be secretly fearing: driving becoming outlawed. Musk made the comments at a conference held by tech company Nvidia on Tuesday. “In the distant future, I think people may outlaw driving cars because it’s too dangerous,” Musk said at the conference. “You can’t have a person driving a two-ton death machine.” Such comments make Musk, who at one point owned a McLaren F1 and has consistently strived to make his company’s Model S electric sedan a more thrilling drive, sound like he favors taking control away from the general public, though comments he made on Twitter after the conference suggest this is not the case. “To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be,” he said on Twitter. “Hopefully, that is obvious.” The strongest argument for autonomous cars is their safety—research has shown that human error is the main cause of crashes. By taking control away from the driver, driving could be made safer, or so the proponents of the technology claim. Those proponents include governments, safety groups and even some automakers, which are committed to accident-free driving. Tesla has added some semi-autonomous features to its Model S. Last fall, the Californian firm announced an ""Autopilot"" feature with some basic functions. Eventually, the Autopilot will be upgraded to give the Model S self-driving capability on the highway from on-ramp to off-ramp, though there’s been no mention of a timeframe for this.

With a full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS anti-glare display and a backlit keyboard with number pad, the Zenbook U500VZ should appeal to content creators, gamers and anyone who craves plenty of portable power. With its aluminum shell and ""hairline"" finish, the U500VZ is designed for style, not just raw performance. However, ASUS is not calling the Zenbook U500VZ an Ultrabook and did not mention weight in its press materials so we don't know yet how this notebook will stack up against other ultraportable 15-inchers like the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and Samsung Series 9 15-inch. The company claims that the U500VZ's battery life is ""impressive"" and that its Super Hybrid II software, which controls system speed, will provide 25 percent longer battery life ""when it's needed most."" We'll put these claims to the test when we get the notebook in for review. ASUS hasn't released pricing or availability information on the U500VZ, but we suspect it will be available in time for the holidays. The notebook will come in several different configurations, some of which will have dual SSDs with up to 512GB of storage and others of which will have a single SSD paired with a hard drive.

2012-07-25,"Help Me, LAPTOP: I Need a Gaming Notebook Under 5 Pounds","Is the MacBook Pro with Retina Display the new king of PC gaming notebooks? Reader Petetor (a victim of Valve's ludicrously low-priced Steam Summer Sale) bought ""Batman: Arkham City"" for dirt-cheap and is looking for a gaming rig powerful enough to play it -- that weighs less than five pounds. My current machine, while still pretty good, can't hope to cope with gameplay like the Batman Arkham series, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Serious Sam 3 or Alan Wake with at least medium settings and decent resolutions. However, the portability it brings to the table (easy to carry around in one hand or in a bag) is a huge plus which I'd like to keep. So, here are the requirements: It should weigh less than 5 pounds. Screen resolution should be at least 1600x900. Graphics capability should be around the level of a GeForce 650M. Monitor quality: anything better than my current's (which has bad vertical viewing angles and uneven brightness). Budget is not necessarily an issue, but of course cheaper would be better. So, do you think that somewhere out there's a laptop that's a good fit for me? The desire to wing your way through the mean streets of Gotham as the Dark Knight, delivering justice to petty thugs with batarangs and well-timed fists to the head, is of course a natural inclination -- as is the desire to avoid damaging your spine by lugging around a ten-pound gaming notebook actually capable of playing ""Arkham City"" on medium settings at more than 30 frames per second. Does a notebook that packs these specs and weighs less than five pounds really exist? The only notebook that really nails every one of Petetor's criteria is the MacBook Pro with retina display ($2,199). This 4.46-pound, 0.71-inch-thick beast sports an Nvidia GeForce GT 650M GPU with 1GB of VRAM and a jaw-dropping 2880 x 1800 display. When playing ""Arkham City"" using Boot Camp, we were able to notch a whopping 115 frames per second with the resolution set to 1366 x 768 and the graphics set to Low -- that is, until the game crashed on us. According to our readers, however, the latest beta drivers for the 650M allow ""Arkham City"" to run on the MacBook Pro, and with excellent frame rates: One reader wrote that he was able to consistently maintain 45 fps with a resolution of 1920 x 1200 and High settings. However, if Petetor wants excellent graphics and at least a 1600 x 900 display, but isn't interested in the MacBook Pro, he's going to have to compromise on weight. We found a number of notebooks powerful enough to handle ""Arkham City"" that weigh just a bit more than five pounds. [See More: Top 10 Notebooks Now] The new Dell XPS 15 ($1,699) delivers on pretty much all of Petetor's criteria: it sports an Nvidia GeForce GT 640M GPU with 2GB of VRAM and a gorgeous 1920 x 1080p Gorilla Glass display, and weighs just 6 pounds. Unfortunately, the system seemed to struggle when running ""Arkham City"" as even with the resolution at 1366 x 768 and the graphics set to Low, the notebook managed only 36 fps. Although the latest drivers from Nvidia may increase performance, the XPS 15 isn't the best choice for playing the latest games. At 6.3 pounds, the 17-inch Samsung Series 7 Chronos ($1,499) weighs just a bit more than the 15-inch XPS 15 and delivers similar graphics performance. While ""Arkham City"" looks excellent on its 1920 x 1080 display, the notebook's Nvidia GeForce GT 650M GPU with 2GB of VRAM managed only 36 frames per second with the resolution at 1366 x 768 and the graphics set to Low. [See More: The Best & Worst Laptop Brands of 2012] Of course, we would be remiss if we failed to mention the Alienware M14x R2, a 14-inch powerhouse featuring a 1600 x 900 display and an Nvidia GeForce GT 650M GPU with 2GB of VRAM. Sure, it weighs 6.4 pounds, but this notebook easily cranked out 41 frames per second while playing ""Arkham City"" at its native resolution and with the graphics set to Low. Unlike with most the systems mentioned above, you could turn on more advanced graphics features and easily maintain a frame rate above 30 fps.

Here's a quick rundown of both machines. Samsung 14-inch Series 5 500 This 5-pound powerhouse is a smart choice for students who want a fast and sleek notebook for work and play. We like the swooping curves on this chassis, as well as the solid tactile feedback provided by the keyboard. Above the keyboard on the Series 5 500 you'll find two unique buttons, one for automatically adjusting power settings to help save juice and another for engaging Samsung EasyShare for sharing files with the click of a button via Wi-Fi Direct. Under the hood is a Core i5-3210M processor and 500GB hard drive, plus Nvidia GeForce GT 630M graphics for playing some ""Diablo III"" between classes. You'll also find a DVD drive, which is easier for loading games than downloading. Too bad the version of the 14-inch Series 5 500 shipping in the U.S. won't sport the same silver-and-white design as the pre-production model we played with. Samsung has opted for a more tame black-and-gray aesthetic, although the brushed-metal like pattern on the lid looks cool.

It also has a roomier 750GB hard drive and adds a subwoofer on the bottom for a serious bass boost. Samsung bundles SoundAlive Technology for adding virtual 3D sound and switching between modes (like music and movies). You also get a dedicated number pad to the right of the keyboard. While the lid is plastic, the finish has the appearance of brushed metal, which resists fingerprints.

2014-01-06,Tech company admits carrying out 'crop circle' stunt to promote new chip,"LAS VEGAS – A 310-foot ""crop circle"" in a California barley field that mystified locals this week was explained Sunday: it was a publicity stunt by Nvidia Corp., a maker of chips for PCs and smartphones. The crop circle near Chualar, Calif., contained a stylized image of a computer chip and the number ""192"" in Braille. On Sunday, the company announced the Tegra K1, a new chip for tablets and smartphones that contains 192 computing ""cores,"" or mini-computers, for graphics applications. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said at a press conference in Las Vegas, ahead of the International Consumer Electronics Show, that he had given his marketing department the mission to promote the chip on a shoe-string budget. The crop circle received wide attention. Rumors of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia's involvement appeared Sunday before the press conference. The circle was plowed under a few days after its discovery. Tablets are becoming a popular platform for gaming, undermining Nvidia's core business of creating powerful chips that enhance the look of PC games. It's had some success with its chips for mobile gadgets like smartphones and tablets, but has been overshadowed by Qualcomm Inc. In the new Tegra K1, the graphics component based on its ""Kepler"" design, used in high-end PCs. The chip would makes for a tablet more powerful than an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 game console, while consuming one-twentieth the power. ""We've bridged the gap -- we've brought mobile computing to the same level as desktop computing,"" Huang said. The 192 cores in the new chip compare to Nvidia's previous flagship, the Tegra 4, with 72 graphics cores. Huang demonstrated near photo-realistic simulations of environments and human faces, run on the new chip. He said Epic Games will adapt the next version of its Unreal Engine, the basis for many popular games, so that it will work on the chip. He didn't announce when the chip would be available or any gadget makers that were adopting it.",FoxNews

These 14- and 15-inch laptops combine Intel's latest third-generation Core processors with high-octane Nvidia 600 series/Kepler graphics and JBL speakers for serious entertaiment oomph. Starting at $899, the new Y series has a premium look and feel, too. Check out our hands-on video and read on for more impressions. The new Y 80 and Y580 look anything like a buttoned-down ThinkPad, thanks to the brushed metal covers and palm rests. The 5-pound Y480 houses a standard 1366 x 768 display, but the 6-pound 15.6-inch model can go up to 1920 x 1080 for full HD gaming.

2017-08-02,HP's virtual reality simulator will 'build' a colony on Mars,"HP is hooking up with chip company Nvidia and others in a ""Mars Home Planet"" project where participants will make 3D models of Martian buildings, cities, vehicles and infrastructure. The ultimate goal is to create a virtual reality (VR) simulation of life on Mars for 1 million people by building on the Mars Valley terrain from Fusion’s “Mars 2030” game, which is based on NASA research. NASA has already identified Mawrth Vallis [Mars Valley] as a potential landing site on Mars and that will be the model for the modeling and rendering, according to HP. “Through HP and partner technology, we are unleashing engineers, architects, designers and students to help anticipate and solve the real world problems we’ll face to inhabit Mars one day,” HP said in a statement. ""People here on earth will be able to experience what life on Mars might be like."" The “collective vision” will be presented in 2018 as a “blueprint for the future,” HP said. Of course, this assumes that the initial monumental challenges, like reaching Mars and subsequent survival, have already been solved. But that aside, the first 10,000 participants to register for the project will get a free Fusion Mars 2030 VR download, available in early August. HP’s VR hardware HP also rolled out a new virtual reality backpack for training in dangerous environments and virtual walkthroughs “at scale” of building designs. One of the biggest challenges of VR is that it requires powerful chips and a connection to a power cord. To solve that, the untethered VR Backpack comes with dual batteries that are easily swapped “to provide unrestricted freedom within an immersive experience,” HP said. And to mitigate dropped frames – a problem with underpowered VR experiences – the backpack uses an Intel Core i7 vPro processor and an Nvidia Quadro P5200 graphics chip with 16GB video memory. An additional docking solution allows more demanding content design. The 10-pound backpack has a quick release and quick snap on design. The harness has two shoulder straps and a belt strap. Thirteen immersion centers will open later this year, including Palo Alto, London and Beijing, among other cities around the world. They have been designed to get customers up to speed on immersive VR computing and to learn how to deploy HP’s VR technology. HP Z VR Backpack is scheduled to be available in September, starting at $3,299.",FoxNews

2015-07-29,AMD may be developing a R9 370X to take on GTX 950,"This generation of the never-ending graphical war between AMD and Nvidia is turning out to be a hotly contested one. Each time a new GPU is announced, another from the other camp rears its head. This looks to be another of those instances, where following a suggestion that Nvidia may be working on a GTX 950, AMD may have its answer: the R9 370X. Although this is all still unconfirmed officially, the evidence is quite strong, as EXPreview (via Hexus) has managed to get a hold of some GPUZ screenshots of the card itself. If correct, they paint a picture of a card that while not as impressive as the flagship Fiji GPU, and should prove competitive -- even if it is looking like another rebrand. The new card will come equipped with 1280 graphics core next (GCN) stream processors, with 32 render output units (ROP) and 80 texture mapping units (TPU). They've been paired with 2GB of GDDR5, running at 1400 MHz through a 256-bit interface. The core itself is clocked at 1180MHz. Essentially it's much the same as the 270X it appears to be based off of, though with some BIOS tweaks to bring performance up a notch. AMD is no doubt hoping that this card, based on years old hardware will provide adequate competition for the GTX 950, if and when it shows up. Although much of this was expected, what is a little more surprising is the naming scheme. While it was thought likely that AMD would rebrand one of its previous generation cards to fill the 370X slot in its lineup, it was thought likely to be called an R7. Instead it's being bundled into the R9 line up. Perhaps that means that AMD will be extending its R7 cards deeper, releasing some even more cost effective solutions, or that it's simply giving less prevalence to the lower end of the spectrum. What do you think AMD has up its sleeve with the R7 series?",FoxNews
2011-05-27,"Hedge fund owner, Nvidia worker guilty on trading","NEW YORK – The government on Friday strengthened its insider trading case against a former consultant for a California research firm by securing guilty pleas and cooperation deals with a former hedge fund portfolio manager and a technology company's senior financial analyst. The pleas by Samir Barai, of Manhattan, and Son Ngoc Nguyen, of San Jose, Calif., included admissions that they had conspired with Winifred Jiau, a former Primary Global Research employee who's set to go on trial in U.S. District Court on Wednesday. Jiau was charged with securities fraud in a probe of securities industry workers who pass off inside information as legitimate research after convincing employees of public companies to provide information about their companies before it is made public. She has pleaded not guilty. Barai, the 39-year-old owner of the Barai Capital Management hedge fund, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud and obstruction after he was arrested in February. Barai admitted during his plea Friday that he instructed a research analyst to shred evidence last November after hearing about the probe. He said he engaged in a scheme to benefit from inside information from 2006 through 2010 and some of his illegal secrets came from Jiau. ""I deeply regret all of my actions in this case,"" he said. His Manhattan sentencing is set for Aug. 29. Earlier Friday, Nguyen, a 39-year-old senior financial analyst at computer chips manufacturer Nvidia Corp., pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in the case in a cooperation deal. He admitted that he shared inside information with Jiau from 2007 through early 2009. Prosecutors allege that the deal among Nguyen, Jiau and a co-conspirator who worked in the finance department of Marvell Technology Group Ltd. called for her to provide inside information about Nvidia and Marvell to Nguyen. Prosecutors said the deal also required that she provide Nguyen and the co-conspirator with stock tips that she learned from contacts she had at various companies. There are no allegations of wrongdoing against Nvidia or Marvell.",FoxNews
2011-11-09,"New nVidia 'Kal-El' Chip Promises Superfast Future for Tablets, Smartphones","It's a superchip for superphones. Chipmaker nVidia, rushing to stake out more territory in tablets and smartphones, said its new Tegra 3 processor delivers up to three times the graphics performance of its predecessor and uses 61 percent less power. Previously code-named ""Project Kal-El"" -- after Superman's boyhood name -- the new quad-core chip is in production and is nVidia's latest bet to expand into the fast-growing mobile market as tablets like Apple's iPad eat into sales of personal computers. Santa Clara, California-based nVidia, which started out making graphics chips for PCs and still makes most of its revenue that way, expects devices using the new processors to be on sale by the end of the year, Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told analysts on a conference call in September. Early in 2011, nVidia's Tegra 2 mobile chip, which is based on architecture licensed from Britain's ARM Holdings, was included in several new gadgets from Samsung Electronics, Asustek Computer and LG Electronics, raising nVidia's profile with investors as well as its stock price. The first tablet to use the Tegra 3 chip will be Asustek's Eee Pad Transformer Prime, nVidia said in a statement. ARM's power-sipping chip architecture is widely favored for mobile devices that depend on batteries and is also used by Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. Intel so far has failed to find a foot hold in the mobile market and is hurrying to adapt its chip architecture, originally designed to make powerful PCs, to work efficiently in smartphones and tablets.",FoxNews
2018-04-25,Latest Nintendo Switch hack can't be patched,"The Nintendo Switch has been available to buy for a little over a year now, and unfortunately for Nintendo, the hybrid console just got hacked. This is no ordinary hack, though, it's one that can't be patched using software alone. In order to render the hack useless, Nintendo and Nvidia need to redesign the Tegra X1 processor at the heart of the Switch. As Eurogamer reports, the exploit comes via well-known console hackers fail0verflow and is called ShofEL2. The vulnerability was disclosed to Nvidia, Nintendo, and Google (due to the Tegra chip's use in Android devices) a while ago, but now a public release has happened simply because so many people are already aware of the vulnerability. In the video below, you can see Linux running on an unmodified Switch thanks to the exploit. The reason Nintendo can't patch to stop the hack is because it's a hardware-based vulnerability being exploited. The bug was found in the Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip and it allows control to be taken during early execution on the Switch meaning signature checks can be bypassed. As the bug exists in the Boot ROM, the only way Nintendo can patch it is at the manufacturing stage. In other words, every Switch released to date and going forward is vulnerable to the exploit until the Tegra chip is modified. For now, the hack is of little use to the typical Switch user. However, in the coming weeks and months two things are likely to happen. The first is the appearance of software tools allowing developers to create games executable on the Switch using the console's own operating system known as Horizon. It's likely we will then see a growing library of homebrew games released independently of Nintendo. The second inevitable thing to happen is piracy. As the exploit allows complete control over the Switch, it won't take long for commercial games to start appearing as ROMs and executable on the Switch. This is clearly the thing Nintendo will be more concerned about. As Eurogamer points out, Nintendo can update the Switch firmware to check for suspicious behavior and block access to online play, or even brick the console. But it will be a cat and mouse game of patches and workarounds going forward. Really what Nintendo needs is a revised Tegra chip from Nvidia as soon as possible.

Smaller children who might not need the raw strength of Nvidia's quad-core processor, however, might be better suited to Fuhu's newly announced Nabi Jr, a $99 5-inch slate that sports more modest internals but otherwise continues down the path blazed by its predecessor. The tablet ships with the Wings Adaptive Learning System, an educational software package that teaches kids the three Rs starting at a pre-K level.

Fuhu's latest slate also sports the same durable red bumper that so impressed us in the Nabi 2, along with a smaller 5-inch display -- the Nabi 2 boasts a 7-inch screen -- that should be easier for tikes to hold in their itty bitty hands. Dual cameras can help to document life's precious moments and icky science experiments alike. The front camera even rotates.

Under the hood, the Nabi Jr sports much more pedestrian specs than the Nabi 2. The slate's still Tegra powered, but it uses a dual-core processor rather than the full-blown quad-core Tegra 3. The 800 x 480 screen resolution is also a step back from the original's 1024 x 600 display, but to be fair, the Nabi Jr's actual screen size is two inches less than the Nabi 2's. The tablet packs Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, as well. Expect the Nabi Jr to launch mid-December at $99 for a model with 4GB of onboard storage, or $129 for a 16GB version.",FoxNews

2012-02-21,"Nvidia Challenges Qualcomm with First Icera Smartphone, ZTE Mimosa X","You need a lot more than a zippy processor and powerful graphics to win the smartphone wars. You also need an integrated modem to woo device makers, which Nvidia has done with the ZTE Mimosa X. Expected to be available in Q2, the mainstream handset packs both a Tegra 2 processor and a modem made by Icera, a company Nvidia acquired in May to be more competitive with Qualcomm and Texas Instruments. The Mimosa X will feature a dual-core CPU, GeForce GPU and Icera 450 HSPA+ modem. Unfortunately, the modem is rated for only 21 Mbps and doesn't tap into 4G LTE networks, unlike such low-cost devices as the Pantech Burst. However, Nvidia promises IceClear interference cancellation technology ""for even faster throughput at the cell edge."" The Mimosa X will run Android Ice Cream Sandwich (OS 4.0) and sport a qHD 4.3-inch screen and 5-MP camera. With Mobile World Congress on tap for next week, we expect to hear a lot more from Nvidia, including phones powered by its quad-core Tegra 3 chip. Nvidia has all but confirmed that the rumored HTC One X (aka HTC Edge) will have its powerhouse inside. Assuming Nvidia can soon pair Tegra 3 with an LTE modem, Qualcomm and TI will have even more reasons to look over their shoulders.",FoxNews
2015-07-02,Some of AMD's new Fury X cards have pump whine,"AMD just can't seem to catch a break. First, its 300 series cards were discovered to be mostly made up of re-branded 200 series GPUs (many of which were re-branded 7000 series chips from 2011). Then the performance of the Fury X fell short of Nvidia's GTX 980 Ti. And now that seem liquid-cooled card is suffering from annoying, persistent pump whine issues. Cards from AMD have been know to run hotter than Nvidia's alternative in recent years, and as such they often have louder coolers. However, many people hoped that the new generation of HBM sporting cards would be more efficient, and thanks to the use of in-built water cooling, quieter too. It turns out that that's not been the case. These concerned appeared in some reviews, as some outlets noticed high levels of noise from the Fury X's pump. AMD quelled these concerns by saying the problem was merely an early batch of samples sent out to reviewers. It assured everyone else that whine was unlikely to be heard in retail cards. However, further tests from the likes of PC Perspective suggest that retail versions of the cards may have been affected, too. AMD has since updated its response to state that some retail cards were also affected by this first batch which had the slightly noisy pump, but that in the future that should not be the case. While this does sound like back-peddling, it isn't exactly clear which cards were tested in the follow up trials, so it may be that the problematic batch ended up supplying both of the tested cards. Have any of you ordered one of the new cards from AMD? If you're on the fence about it, do the new claims over pump whine make you want to change your mind?",FoxNews

2013-01-14,Panasonic 4K Tablet Hands-on: Screens Don't Get Much Better,"If CES 2013 is remembered for one thing, it will be 4K display technology. Electronics giants ranging from LG and Samsung to Panasonic and more each had their own 4K televisions, sporting sky-high resolutions that put current generation 1080p displays to shame. But 4K resolution isn't reserved for televisions alone. Panasonic is here debuting its new 20-inch 4K resolution Windows 8 tablet, and after spending some time with it, we can safely say its display is nothing short of astounding. Currently in development for the enterprise market, the massive tablet packs a 1.8-GHz Intel Core i5 3427U processor , Nvidia Geforce graphics, 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, meaning it'll be powerful enough to handle almost anything you throw at it. But the real star of the show is the tablet's display. At 3840 x 2560 pixels, the resolution is off the charts. Images were sharp and colors rendered beautifully. To give us an example of how impressive the 4K tablet's display truly is, Panasonic opened up a profile photo of a young Native American girl. Zoom in on the girl's eye and you can clearly see the reflection of the photographer who shot the image. Despite its 20-inch size, Panasonic's tablet is still very attractive. It's white bezel surrounded by a second metal bezel that wraps around the edges to the tablet's rear. Along its right edge are buttons for the display's volume, power and a screen lock. Below those are the device's inputs including microUSB, power and a microSD card slot. Our one complaint about the tablet was how hot its back panel got. In fact, holding the tablet in our hands was actually a bit painful. Panasonic, however, assured us that the heat problem was a result of the tablet being in its prototype stages and that the issue would be resolved before the unit makes it way to the market later this year. And when it does, we'll have a complete review for your reading pleasure.",FoxNews

2002-02-15,Nvidia Shares Drop on SEC Probe News,"NEW YORK – Investors pushed the sell button on shares of Nvidia Corp. on Friday after the graphics chip maker stirred up Enron-like jitters with news that it was the subject of a federal accounting investigation. Even as Wall Street brokerages rushed to defend the company and reiterated recommendations to buy the stock, the shares closed down $4.81, or 7.7 percent, to $57.35, on Nasdaq, where it was among the most active issues on volume of more than 33 million shares. Nvidia stock was the best performer in the Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> index last year, a distinction it inherited from Enron Corp., the index's best performer of 2000. Enron has since fallen apart in an explosive accounting and ethics scandal. Even with Friday's stock drop, Nvidia shares are still trading more than three times higher than in January 2000. Wall Street had flocked to Nvidia, attracted by its valuable relationships with computer and video game system makers, including Microsoft Corp. , which uses Nvidia chips in its Xbox game system. In November, Nvidia was hit by news of an inquiry into alleged insider trading by company employees. The latest SEC probe stemmed from the commission's review of e-mail messages Nvidia had provided as part of the insider trading inquiry. On Thursday, Nvidia said the SEC was looking into the timing of up to $3.6 million in product costs recorded in the second and third quarters of its 2001 fiscal year. In addition, the company said the SEC was examining the recording of reserves in the fiscal 2000 fourth quarter and the fiscal 2001 first quarter. Nvidia's fiscal year ends in January. The sell-off came even though Nvidia on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the fiscal 2002 fourth quarter. Profits more than doubled amid strong sales of the game consoles and computers that use its chips to display complex graphics. The SEC inquiry comes in the context not only of the Enron scandal, but amid the swelling number of technology companies facing informal or even formal inquiries into their accounting. Telecommunications companies Global Crossing Ltd. and Britain's Cable & Wireless Plc are two such firms facing scrutiny. Even blue-chip International Business Machines Corp. has been affected, with its shares dragged down on Friday over a report on concerns about how it accounted for an asset sale. Brokerage firms sent out research notes early Friday backing up Nvidia. ""We believe that the accounting questions facing NVDA are relatively benign,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Edelstone wrote in a research note, using the stock symbol for Nvidia. ""We believe NVDA remains one of the most attractive stocks in our universe,"" he added. Stock analysts refer to their industry coverage area as their ""universe."" At Credit Suisse First Boston, analyst Tim Mahon said the drop in Nvidia stock presented a good buying opportunity for investors. In a research note entitled ""Another Record Quarter,"" he raised their estimate for Nvidia's fiscal 2003 earnings to $1.76 a share from $1.32 a share. Joseph Osha, an semiconductor analyst with Merrill Lynch, maintained his 12-month ""buy"" recommendation on the stock and a 3-year ""strong buy"" rating. But Osha warned in a research note that ""no stock, regardless of how strong the business is, will react well to questions about accounting practices in the current environment."" ""With Nvidia now under a microscope, additional issues could come up,"" he wrote.",FoxNews
2003-05-09,"Stocks Boosted by Nvidia, Intel","NEW YORK – Stocks rose Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq chalking up their first four-week winning streak since October, as encouraging forecasts from computer chip companies Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Intel Corp. (INTC) helped lure investors back into the market. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 113.38 points, or 1.34 percent, at 8,604.60, according to the latest available data. It was the Dow's highest finish since Jan. 16. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 13.14 points, or 1.43 percent, to 933.41. The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 30.46 points, or 2.04 percent, to 1,520.15. For the week, the S&P 500 gained 0.36 percent, the Dow added 0.25 percent and Nasdaq advanced 1.15 percent. For the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, this marked their fourth straight week of gains for the first time since October 2002. ""The Nvidia news was pretty good on the chip makers, and there's sort of a general upward trend,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView, which oversees $1 billion. ""It's a combination of still positive feelings over the end of the war and the fact that earnings season held no real disappointments."" Nvidia shares soared 33.06 percent Friday, a day after the graphics chip designer reported a smaller profit and lower revenue in its fiscal first quarter, but forecast revenue would rise sharply in the current quarter. Nvidia ended up $5.31 at $21.37, topping Nasdaq's most actives. ""When you have industry leaders saying they think there will be a slight recovery in the PC market, there's a whole domino effect with software companies and chip companies doing better,"" said Tim Smalls, managing director at SG Cowen Securities. ""That's the area where you have to get the market moving — through capital expenditures on the corporate side,"" he added. ""Unless we get that, we'll drift lower."" The S&P 500 index has surged about 16 percent since mid-March on hopes the economy will improve later this year, but several reports have pointed to a tepid recovery so far. Stocks extended gains after U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow said he sees no risk of significant deflation in the United States. His remarks helped ease concerns after the Federal Reserve warned Tuesday that an ""unwelcome substantial fall in inflation"" could lead to economic weakness. Intel, the No. 1 computer chip maker, ended up 71 cents, or 3.76 percent, at $19.58. Intel President Paul Otellini said he expects the semiconductor industry to recover this year, German financial daily Handelsblatt reported Friday. Coca Cola Co. (KO) 's stock jumped 2.59 percent after investment bank Bear Stearns upgraded Coke to ""outperform"" from ""peer perform,"" citing its improved long-term business model and depressed stock price. Coke shares gained $1.11 to $43.99. Gateway Inc. (GTW) rallied 25 cents, or 8.36 percent, to $3.24. Gateway, which posted losses in nine of the past 10 quarters, said it aimed to return to profitability this year by launching new products outside its struggling personal computer business. The plan is part of a strategy to turn itself from a PC maker into a broader computing and home electronics brand, Chief Executive Ted Waitt told analysts at Gateway's annual meeting Thursday. Among losers, ImClone Systems Inc. (IMCL) sank $1.21, or 5.81 percent, to $19.63. Imclone's auditors are insisting on a broad review of its finances, raising concern the biotechnology company will not be able to file its 2002 annual report before a May 15 stock delisting hearing, The Wall Street Journal reported. Advancers trounced decliners by a ratio of 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and 11 to 5 on the Nasdaq. Trading was active, with about 1.31 billion shares changing hands on the Big Board, and roughly 1.55 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq. The Russell 2000 index, a barometer of smaller company stocks, rose 5.85, or 1.4 percent, to 413.53. Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average finished 1.5 percent higher Friday. In Europe, France's CAC-40 rose 1 percent, Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1 percent and Germany's DAX index increased 2.4 percent. Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",FoxNews
2012-02-28,"Fujitsu Tegra 3 Phone Hands-On: Fingerprint Reader, Physical Buttons","HTC and LG aren't the only ones getting into the Tegra 3 smartphone game. Japanese electronics vendor Fujitsu, which sells a lot of smartphones in Asia but none in the U.S., showed off its own prototype Android handset based on Nvidia's quad-core processor at Mobile World Congress. The as-yet-unnamed 4.6-inch Fujitsu Tegra 3 smartphone sports a 4.6-inch, 1280 x 800 screen that looked very sharp in our brief hands-on, but not as colorful as the AMOLED screen on the Samsung Galaxy or the Super LCD panel on the HTC One X. We're not sure whether it was the screen or the software build or something else, but the screens on the three sample devices we played with didn't always recognize our swipes. The black, matte plastic chassis on the Fujitsu Tegra 3 phone looks rough, unfinished, and downright ugly, but we can only assume that Fujitsu will make some changes to the design before launch. Like HTC, LG, and ZTE, Fujitsu does not agree with Google's decision to make Ice Cream Sandwich's navigation buttons virtual icons. In fact, the company disagrees so strongly that it is using hard plastic, physical navigation buttons below the screen rather than the less-obtrustive flat capacitive buttons used by others. On its back side, the Fujitsu Tegra 3 smartphone sports a whopping 13.3-MP camera that's low-light sensitive and capable of shooting at ISO 25600. We can't vouch for the quality of the images, but, when we fired up the camera app and hit the shutter button, the phone took a very noticeable couple of seconds to shoot, meaning that it's not capable of the kind of high-speed shooting we've seen on HTC's One Series. Perhaps the most unique feature of Fujitsu's Tegra 3 phone is a fingerprint reader, which sits just below the camera lens on the back of the device. The company currently offers biometric security on a number of its phones so the Tegra 3 phone is just following their lead. Unfortunately, there was no software on the Tegra 3 that we could use to test the reader. As far as software goes, the demo units on display had nothing more than stock Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, with a couple of gaming apps installed and a bright pink wallpaper on one of the devices. Perhaps Fujitsu and its carriers will make some significant changes to the default look of Android before this comes out. Though we did not have the opportunity to surf the web or play videos on the Fujitsu Tegra 3 smartphone, we were able to play a game of the demanding jet ski racing game Riptide GP, which we've tested before on Tegra 3 tablets. As on the Galaxy Transformer Prime tablet, Riptide GP was speedy and detailed with lots of gorgeous water effects. Though Fujitsu has no name for its Tegra 3 phone, a rep did tell us it was likely to be a member of the ""Arrow"" line of handsets. No word yet on pricing or availability, but it's not likely to come to the U.S.",FoxNews

Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal's popular tech news site said the company would hold one of its trademark events during the first week in March, presumably at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, Apple's go-to location for this type of event. The launch event would not necessarily mark availability of the iPad 3, though AllThingsD speculated that it would be available a week or so after the event, following the timing of the iPad 2 launch. Rumors have swirled about the next-generation version of the groundbreaking tablet computer for months, often spurred by news from Taiwanese suppliers or people familiar with the supply chain. So what will it look like? What sort of cool tech specs will we see? Rumors have suggested monster graphics features thanks to nVidia chips and superfast processing speeds thanks to quad-core chips from ARM or Texas Instruments. AllThingsD offers a similar analysis, again citing unnamed sources. The iPad 3 will be similar in form factor to the iPad 2, but running a much faster chip, sporting an improved graphics processing unit, and featuring a higher resolution, 2,048×1,536 Retina Display — or something close to it, the site said.

2015-07-05,Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync? Pick a side and stick with it,"If you've ever experienced screen tearing in a PC game, you know how annoying it can be. An otherwise perfectly-rendered title totally ruined by gross horizontal lines and stuttering. You can turn on V-Sync, but if you don't have a high-end system, it can put a huge dent in your performance. Both Nvidia and AMD have stepped up to try and solve the issue while preserving framerates, and both manufacturers have turned to adaptive refresh technology for the solution. G-Sync and FreeSync are both designed to smooth out gameplay, reduce input lag, and prevent screen tearing. They have different methods for accomplishing these goals, but what really sets them apart is that one side closely guards them, and the other shares them openly. While Nvidia's G-Sync is enabled by including a chip in the construction of the monitor, FreeSync uses the video card's functionality to manage the refresh rate of the monitor using the Adaptive Sync standard built into the DisplayPort standard. Screen tearing and stuttering are the effect of a misalignment between the number of frames your graphics card is rendering per second, and the number of times your monitor is refreshing. If your screen is in the middle of drawing one image, and is handed another, it stops what it's doing and draws the new one. That causes stuttering as the image catches up, or a horizontal tear where portions of two frames are on screen at the same time. Nvidia If you've ever noticed the problem before, you might have turned on V-Sync to alleviate the issue and noticed a drop in performance. This is because V-Sync locks frame output to the expected refresh rate of the monitor, which is almost always 60Hz (60 refreshes per second). That's great if your computer can evenly output 60 frames each second, but if it can't, V-Sync has to drop down to a division of 60 FPS -- usually 30 FPS, and if your PC can't hold that, 20 FPS, or lower. V-Sync works as it does because a normal monitor cannot talk to the video card. It refreshes at the same rate, all the time, no matter the frames sent to it. Adaptive sync technology makes it possible for your monitor's refresh rate to vary to match the output of your video card. That prevents screen tearing without locking the framerate to 60 FPS or lower. Unfortunately, not all technologies are created equal. If you want to get in on some buttery smooth gaming action, you'll have to decide. Nvidia, or AMD? One of the first differences you'll hear people talk about when it comes to adaptive refresh technology, besides AMD vs Nvidia, is the difference between a closed and an open standard. While G-Sync is proprietary Nvidia technology, and requires the company's permission and cooperation to use, FreeSync is free to use, and implementing it is a goal of the program, not a way to make money. That should mean that FreeSync is more widely adopted, but in actuality, they're about even -- for now. G-Sync has been around longer, and it's also managed by Nvidia, the current leader in GPU manufacturing. That may prevent AMD's lead in compatible monitors from getting out of hand, or might not. Only time will tell. Either way, you can't mix and match between the two technologies. You have to choose whether you want to go with Nvidia or AMD, and then purchase a monitor and GPU accordingly. It's tough to talk about cost when it comes to incorporating a refresh management technology into your rig. The reason is that there's a cost on both sides -- at the GPU, and in the monitor. If you go the Nvidia route, the module in the monitor is going to handle a lot of the heavy lifting involved in adjusting the refresh rate. That's going to be reflected in the price you pay for the monitor, since each manufacturer has to pay Nvidia for the hardware. The upside is that the technology has been readily available since early 2014, so it's available in monitors as cheap as $500, like the BenQ XL2420G. The G-Sync module also does most of the heavy lifting, so as long as your monitor is compatible, you can use lower end cards. Nvidia lists the compatible options, which range from the Titan X and 980 Ti all the way down the 650 Ti Boost, which retails for less than $200. Asus You won't end up paying much extra for a monitor with FreeSync. There's no premium to the manufacturer to include it, unlike G-Sync. As such, these monitors start around $500 as well, but you'll get a 1440p display and a 144Hz refresh rate at that price point. You'll also need a card that supports FreeSync, and unless it's an R9 or high-end R7 card, it doesn't. At less than $100, you can install an R7 260, the most basic card in the Radeon lineup that supports FreeSync. There's also a performance difference between the two standards in a number of different areas. Users have noted that although tearing and stuttering are reduced with FreeSync enabled, another problem arises -- ghosting. As objects move on the screen, they leave behind a bit of the image of their last position like a shadow. It's an artifact that some people don't notice at all, and really annoys others. There are a lot of fingers being pointed at what might be causing it, but the physical reason for it is power management. If you don't apply enough power to the pixels, your image will have gaps in it, too much power, and you'll see ghosting. It's hard to balance the adaptive refresh technology with proper power distribution. Both systems also start to suffer when the framerate isn't consistently within the monitor's refresh range. G-Sync can show problems with flickering at very low framerates, and while the technology usually compensates to fix it, there are exceptions. FreeSync, meanwhile, has stuttering problems if framerate drops below a monitor's stated minimum refresh rate. Most reviewers who've compared the two side-by-side seem to prefer the quality of G-Sync, which does not show stutter issues at low framerates, and thus smoother in real-world situations. Some FreeSync monitors have an extremely narrow adaptive refresh range, and if your video card can't deliver frames within that range, problems arise. In the past year the number of monitors with G-Sync built in has exploded, but if you're planning on improving your gaming rig, you also want a monitor with the right specs. We've reviewed some monitors that are equipped with G-Sync, and here are a few of our favorites. The XB280HK was the first 4K monitor to support G-Sync, and still a great choice for gaming, with or without a compatible card. It has a 1ms response time, and a variable refresh rate for G-Sync. We lauded the XB280HK for its sturdy build quality and solid gaming performance, and it's a great choice if you're heading the G-Sync route. From the ASUS Republic of Gamers line, the PG278Q Swift is an exceptional gaming monitor with 1440p resolution, and a 60-144Hz refresh rate to take full advantage of the G-Sync module built in. The price is a bit high, starting around $700 when it's on sale, but it's a great option if you don't want to make the move to 4K yet. The Acer XG270HU is almost identical to the XB280HK, with a few key differences. The first is that this version sports FreeSync instead of Nvidia's G-Sync protocol. It also sports a thinner side bezel for multi-monitor setups, as well as cutting the screen size by an inch. It's an excellent value if you're choosing AMD. This Samsung display sacrifices a perfect response time of 1ms for a slightly slower 4ms time, but makes up for it with a very appealing price point, especially for a 4K display. It's only a 23 inch display, which actually give it a really high pixel density, and should make your games look especially clean and smooth. Without any other components, you should expect to spend almost a thousand dollars on a G-Sync compatible monitor and graphics card, more if you want to step up to a graphics card that can actually handle 4K gaming. For around $600, you can get into the base level of FreeSync's compatibility, and that includes a 4K display and a baseline Radeon card -- the R7 260, which is not capable of high performance 4K gaming. The upside is that it won't take much more than $200 more to get you a lot farther up the AMD scaled into an R9 290, which is capable of some 4K gaming. Given the price gap, you might wonder why anyone would prefer G-Sync. The answer is simple -- it's superior. If Nvidia's adaptive refresh technology doesn't suffer ghosting issues and delivers more consistent overall performance. It's also worth noting that Nvidia video cards are currently the performance king. Going with FreeSync, and thus buying an AMD Radeon card, might mean purchasing hardware that delivers less bang for your buck. Ultimately, both of these technologies largely accomplish their goals and deliver an experience that's superior to V-Sync. Your choice will depend on whether you prefer value or a top-notch gaming experience.",FoxNews
2015-12-01,Lenovo teaches another ThinkPad how to do Yoga,"As more users find themselves in need of the serious computing power of a workstation, Lenovo is responding by presenting even more options for professional, workhorse machines. This time around, the workstations are receiving the obligatory Skylake upgrade, as well as some display and form factor upgrades to chew on. First up is the ThinkPad P40 Yoga. This creative device achieves a hybrid status through the use of a 360-degree hinge and a high-resolution 2,560 x 1,440 IPS touchscreen with 2,048 pressure sensitivity levels -- twice as many as the 3,000 x 2,000 display in the Microsoft Surface Book. Despite its portable and convertible form factor, it's still a mobile workstation, so under the hood is a Skylake Core i7 and an Nvidia Quadro m500m with 2GB of VRAM. The other two machines are a bit more routine in their updates. The ThinkPad P50s completes the top end of the Thinkpad P series mobile workstations, with the same sixth generation Core i7 chip availability. The display measures up to a full 3K IPS, and a hot-swappable battery means you don't ever have to stop working, unless you want to. Even if you don't have spare battery the system can last more than two work days, as Lenovo quotes 17 hours of endurance with the largest optional units. Finally, the ThinkStation P310 is the Skylake update to the entry-level P300S desktop workstation. It's available with Skylake Core i3, i5, or i7 chips, as well as the Xeon E3-1200v5, plus choice of Nvidia Quadro GPUs. If that doesn't get your engine going, there's support for Samsung M.2 drives with NVMe SSDs, plus 64GB of RAM. Things look even brighter when it comes to price. The ThinkPad P40 Yoga starts at just $1,399, while the ThinkPad P50s starts at $1,299. If the desktop seems more appropriate, it starts at just $729, a downright bargain for a workstation, depending on what that configuration looks like. All three of the new workstations will be available starting in Q1 of 2016, but their earlier counterparts are already available directly from Lenovo.",FoxNews
2012-03-21,"Sprint and HTC Collaboration Event April 4th, HTC One X on Way?","Sprint and HTC sent out invitations today for an April 4th press event the two say will show off their, ""latest collaboration."" Now what could these two be announcing that warrants its own press conference? Well, according to TechnoBuffalo, which cites a, ""reliable Sprint source, the event will serve as the big unveiling for Sprint's version of the much anticipated HTC One X. It could be called the ""Jet,"" according to s4gru, and possibly launch June 10th. If the rumors are true, then the One X could launch in June, which is right about the time Sprint is expected to flip the switch on its 4G LTE network. An AT&T version of the phone has already been announced, but instead of using Nvidia's hulking quad-core Tegra 3 processor, that phone will instead ship with a dual-core Snapdragon chip. We spent some hands-on time with the One X at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and were blown away. The 4.7-inch phone's 1280 x 720 Super LCD 2 display was a sight to behold. On top of its gorgeous display, the Android 4.0-powered One X packs Beats Audio, as well as HTC's Sense 4. But the real reason to get excited about the One X is the freakishly fast 0.7-second Image Sense camera. HTC equipped the phone with a dedicated camera co-processor, allowing it to snap pictures in an instant. Intel's Atom Z2460-powered smartphone can pop off 10 pictures in the same 0.7-seconds, but it's not close to shipping. We'll keep you updated on Sprint and HTC's announcement when it happens early next month. via TechnoBuffalo",FoxNews
2021-09-17,Meghan Markle's dad Thomas reacts to Time 100 cover: 'There are far more influential people',"Thomas Markle apparently wasn't too impressed by Time magazine's 100 most influential people issue -- even though his daughter, Meghan Markle, and her husband, Prince Harry, were one of the few selected for the cover. They were listed as two of the world's most influential people and honored for their activism and philanthropy by friend chef José Andrés. In addition to the couple, Olympian Simone Biles, Oscar winner Kate Winslet, singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, CEO of NVIDIA Jensen Huang and writer Cathy Park Hong, were all featured on the various covers. In a video obtained by Fox News, Markle is seen at a newsstand in Los Angeles and when asked by the videographer why he decided not to purchase the magazine, Markle responds, ""Well that is only Time magazine’s opinion, there are far more influential people, like the Queen."" On Wednesday, Time magazine revealed their cover stars. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were part of the ""Icons"" section of the list. The two posed together but caught some backlash on social media for their ""awkward"" appearances. Harry, whose 37th birthday was also on Wednesday, was dressed in all black and sat behind Meghan with a hand on her shoulder. The former actress, 40, donned a white pantsuit and gold jewelry. After the cover was unveiled, users on Twitter were quick to judge their body language and blank expressions. One person said, ""The only effort in this pic is the person who’s photoshopped 2 different pictures together."" Another pointed out, ""Looks a bit too ‘plasticky’? The photoshop is rich on this one."" ""Terrible retouching job. They look CGI,"" agreed a user. ""What a strange photo… it’s made to look like Harry is the same height as Meghan … is he bending over?"" commented someone else. ""This looks like Harry is her hairdresser and he’s looking into the mirror explaining what he did to her layers,"" joked a user. Meanwhile, chef Andrés wrote in his essay about the couple, ""They turn compassion into boots on the ground through their Archewell Foundation. They give voice to the voiceless through media production."" ""Hand in hand with nonprofit partners, they take risks to help communities in need — offering mental-health support to black women and girls in the US and feeding those affected by natural disasters in India and the Caribbean,"" he continued. Andrés, who founded the World Central Kitchen, worked with Harry and Meghan over the past year to help feed poor communities. ""In a world where everyone has an opinion about people they don’t know, the duke and duchess have compassion for the people they don’t know. They don’t just opine. They run toward the struggle,"" he said.",FoxNews

2012-09-28,"Razer Sharpens Blade Gaming Notebook With Faster CPU, GPU","Razer is officially putting the gaming laptop industry on notice. Come September 30, the company's second iteration of its Razer Blade notebook will be available for purchase. Featuring over 100 tweaks and improvements, it's a force to be reckoned with. Boasting a slim 0.88-inch aluminum chassis, the 6.6 pound Blade is one of the thinnest and lightest gaming notebooks on the market. But don't assume that the Blade's skinny profile means Razer's skimped on the specs. The 17.3-inch notebook is packing a 17.3-inch full HD display, Nvidia GTX 660M GPU, 8GB of RAM, a 500GB 7,200-rpm hard drive and a 64GB SSD. A yet to be announced Core i7 processor will be powering the whole affair. Razer's innovative Switchblade interface, complete with multitouch LCD touchpad and 10 progammable macro keys are also making an appearance. Razer has also left USB 2.0 in the past with 3 USB 3.0 ports. There's a catch. The Blade is going on sale for the wallet-emptying price of $2,499. Which should come as no surprise to dedicated PC gamers; something this slick-looking is never cheap. Sticker shock aside, we were impressed with the overall presentation of the chassis. It looks like the love child of an Alienware M17x and a MacBook Pro. While we have yet to run our benchmarks, we're eager to put the new, improved Razer Blade through some rigorous testing, including an all-night fragging session.

2022-07-21,Gabbard says 'system is rigged' after public conjecture over Paul Pelosi stock buy,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., continues to face questions over a stock purchase her businessman husband Paul Pelosi made in semiconductor company Nvidia ahead of a congressional vote on related chips subsidy legislation. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a onetime Democratic presidential candidate, told Fox News the allegations being bandied about are similar to what she saw while she was in the chamber. ""What we're seeing here is the same thing that I saw when I was in Congress — is this blatant corruption being exposed in broad daylight — the system is rigged,"" she said on ""Jesse Watters Primetime."" ""We have people in positions of power to pass legislation, to enact new policies. They can see, 'OK, here are the industries or companies that will benefit from this. I'm going to go and make these investments, buy this stock or that stock, or have my husband or wife do it and then make money in the process,'"" Gabbard explained. Gabbard did not comment in detail about conjecture about Pelosi, but said she introduced legislation during her time in office that would put a tighter ban on such a dynamic between lawmakers, family members and the markets. ""I think it's important also to look at this, especially in the environment that we're in right now. What is even more dangerous than what we're seeing here is that we have members of Congress who are investing in companies or industries that will benefit from a new Cold War or conflict, for example,"" she added. ""And these are the very same people who are making the policies, who have a vested interest in stoking those tensions and amping up this new Cold War, directly benefiting from it, and simultaneously undermining our actual national security for our country and the interests of the American people."" Fox News Digital previously asked the speaker if Paul had ever made stock purchases or trades after hearing about the financial goings-on of Capitol Hill. ""No,"" Pelosi said. ""Absolutely not.""

2011-06-15,AMD Challenges Intel With Launch of New Chip,"Advanced Micro Devices, nearing half a year without a chief executive, is launching new processors aimed at mainstream personal computers and challenging rivals Intel and Nvidia. AMD's Llano chips, which include both central and graphics processors, are aimed at mid- to high-end laptops and desktop computers. The chips, part of AMD's Fusion family, have much-improved battery life and will soon be available in laptop and desktop computers, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said. A one percentage point increase in notebook market share would increase AMD's revenue by $137 million, according to UBS analyst Uche Orji. Some analysts speculate that Intel, whose processors are in 80 percent of the world's PCs, might respond to any signs it is losing sales by reducing its prices. Exploding sales of Apple's iPad are hurting demand for personal computers and investors have punished the shares of AMD and Intel this year because both companies have yet to stake out significant territory in the mobile market. AMD's board abruptly removed Chief Executive Dirk Meyer in January because of concerns he had not targeted tablet computers and smartphones. Intel this year launched its own new lineup of PC chips, also with combined central and graphics processing, but investors have been far more interested in the company's lack of progress in mobile. Meanwhile, the graphics horsepower added into AMD and Intel's new chips is expected to be more than enough for many PC users, reducing the demand for add-on graphics processors that Silicon Valley rival Nvidia has specialized in for years. Aware of the limited future of its core PC graphics market, Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia is using its graphics expertise to expand into the fast-expanding market for low-power processors in tablets and smartphones. AMD's new chips are the culmination of its $5.4 billion acquisition of Canadian graphics chip designer ATI in 2006.",FoxNews
2016-10-14,Former San Francisco 49er Bruce Miller Selling $1.55M Santa Clara Home,"Bruce Miller, a former San Francisco 49ers tight end, has put his 2,300-square-foot home on the market in red-hot Santa Clara, CA, for $1.55 million. The listing comes less than a month after he was arrested on charges he attacked a man and his elderly father. He was cut by the team shortly thereafter. Listed on Oct. 10, the home is already in pending status. It has four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms and sits on a 4,100-square-foot lot in the city's Rivermark neighborhood. The neighborhood is near the headquarters of major Silicon Valley employers such as Cisco, Intel, and Nvidia. It's also less than 2 miles away from Levi's Stadium, home of the 49ers. Built in 2003, the two-story, Contemporary Spanish -- style home features hardwood flooring, new carpeting, and custom paint. The living room has a surround-sound speaker system, a gas fireplace, and light-filtering window shades. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet and a master bathroom with dual sinks, marble flooring, and a frameless shower. The kitchen includes granite countertops, white cabinets, stainless-steel appliances, and an island. Miller bought the home in mid-2014 for $1.4 million. Miller, 29, was drafted in 2011 by the 49ers for a fullback position. He recorded 62 rushing yards on 28 carries and 734 receiving yards on 76 catches, for a total of four career touchdowns. He was set to switch positions and become a tight end in 2016, under new head coach Chip Kelly. Miller was arrested in early September on multiple counts of assault and battery, after he allegedly tried to barge into an elderly couple's hotel room in San Francisco and got in a fight with a 70-year-old man and his son, who was staying next door. The team released him from his contract later that day. In 2015, Miller pleaded no contest to charges he pushed his then-girlfriend into a wall and smashed her cellphone.",FoxNews
2012-06-28,Hands-on with the Jelly Bean-fueled Google Nexus 7,"Hot on the heels of Microsoft's Surface, Google on Wednesday unveiled its first branded tablet, the Nexus 7 at the I/O developer conference. With a powerful quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 CPU, a bright 1,280 x 800 screen and the brand new Android 4.1 Jelly Bean OS on board, this is one slick slate. We had the chance go hands-on with the tablet at a Google demo station and then unbox a review unit we received and use it from first power-on. At just 0.7 pounds, the Nexus 7 feels pretty light in the hand, but still has a very solid base with a little heft. With its rubberized back, which appeared dark gray in a demo unit on the show floor but white in our review unit, the tablet is really pleasant to hold in the hand. As you might expect from a tablet this size, the device doesn't have much in the way of ports as there's only a single 3.5mm headphone jack and a micro USB charging port. However, we really appreciate the choice of standard micro USB for charging. That means you don't need proprietary cables; any standard USB cable and AC adapter will do fine. The right side of the device houses a volume rocker and the power button and the left side has a four pin gold contact area that could be used for docking in the future. As with most tablets, the screen is incredibly glossy and reflects overhead light back you. When filming videos of the tablet, it was hard to avoid reflections. The display is also a fingerprint magnet, prominently showing smudges. Above the screen sits the front-facing 1,280 x 960 resolution camera; there's no back facer so forget about shooting photos or videos. This device only takes pictures for chat. When turned all the way up, the screen appears colorful and vibrant. However, we haven't had the chance to put it next to competing devices like the Toshiba Excite or the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 to see how it compares. Operating System and Software There's a reason why Google assigned Android version 4.1 to its new Jelly Bean OS, rather than going all the way to version 5.0. The new UI looks nearly identical to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, with only a few subtle changes here and there. As with Ice Cream Sandwich, the bottom of the screen has three software menu buttons for back, home and recent apps. On the home screens, there's a nav bar with 7 icons, the first of which is a configurable folder that opens to reveal several apps including YouTube. Other default icons along the bottom include Google Books, Google Magazines, the apps menu button, Google Movies, Google Music and the Play Store. You can remove or change any of these but the Apps menu button. Apps The Nexus 7 comes with all the basic apps, but nothing extra. These include the calculator, calendar, clock, Google Earth, Email, Gmail, Gallery, Google+, Maps, Messenger, Play Magazines, Play Movies, and Search. In a brief look through these apps, most looked the same as their Ice Cream Sandwich counterparts, but we did notice a couple of differences off the bat. The YouTube app has a left pane that helps you find new channels and the Google Search app now takes voice commands. On the floor demo unit, we were able to get a Google Now button by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. However, it only took us into the search app, not any kind of special Google Now Area. The review unit did not the Google Now functionality enabled. We haven't had a chance try out all of Jelly Bean's new features yet, but our favorite so far is the enhanced notification drawer. When we received an email in our Gmail account, the notification bar showed the first few words of our message. However, when we dragged the notification down, we were able to read several sentences of the messages,without leaving the drawer. Inside the Box The Nexus 7 comes in a thick black cardboard box with a colorful sleeve over it. Inside, you'll find the tablet itself, along with a small box that contains a micro USB cable and an AC adapter. There's also a tiny Quick Start guide. When we first powered on the device, it took less than 30 seconds to power on and bring us to a welcome screen. After that, we had to pick a wireless network, log in to our Google account and decide whether we wanted to back up the device to the cloud. Within a couple of minutes we were at the desktop and had a free $25 Play store credit to boot. The five desktops contain a lot of entertainment widgets. The furthest right desktop is filled with music recommendations. The second from the right has the My Movies widget which has a free copy of Transformers: Dark of the Moon while the center screen has the My Library widget, complete with a few free magazines including Popular Science, Shape and Esquire. The second to the left desktop has more My Books and My Magazines widgets and the far left desktop has the recommended apps widget. It's clear that Google wants to push its Play store pretty hard.",FoxNews
2012-06-13,Acer Launches Iconia Tab A700: 1080p Android Tegra 3 Tablet for Just $449,"Now here's an Android tablet that might compete, resolution- and price-wise, with the new iPad. The Acer Iconia Tab A700 features a 10.1-inch touchscreen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, the highest we've seen on an Android tablet to date. Inside this Ice Cream Sandwich slate sports a 1.3-GHz Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor, 1GB of memory, and 32GB of storage. Not bad for $449. In addition to having a resolution of 1920 x 1080, Acer says that the A700's display has an 800:1 contrast ratio and 178-degree viewing angles. Like Toshiba's Excite 10 and Excite 13, the A700's touchscreen supports up to 10 touch points simultaneously. Not the thinnest or lightest tablet, the A700 measures a reasonable 11.5 x 6.9 x 0.43 inches and weighs 1.5 pounds. It has one microUSB port, one microHDMI port, and a memory card slot capable of accepting SDXC 2.0 cards. The back of the A700 will have a 5-MP camera, and the front a 1-MP camera. Additionally, the tablet's audio is boosted by Dolby Mobile 3 technology, and can pump out 5.1-channel sound via HDMI. Acer says the A700's 9800 mAh battery should get up to 11 hours on video playback over Wi-Fi, and up to 13 hours playing movies from the device itself. Stay tuned for our full review.",FoxNews
2018-06-21,Nintendo can 'perfectly detect' and ban pirate Switch games,"Back in April, a Switch hack was discovered that can't be patched by Nintendo without Nvidia being asked to redesign the Tegra X1 processor. However, if you're tempted to download and play pirate copies of Switch games online, think again, as Nintendo can ""perfectly detect"" illegal copies of Switch titles. As IGN reports, Reddit user SciresM carried out research on how Switch games are authorized when played online. It turns out Nintendo implemented a four stage process which allows for ""very strong anti-piracy measures."" This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.",FoxNews
2012-08-09,AMD- and Nvidia-Compatible Lucid Virtu Graphics Switching Technology Now Supports OpenGL API,"One of the biggest pitfalls of portable gaming machines is their relative lack of portability; even if you can put up with the bulk of a gaming laptop, discrete graphics cards don't sip power -- they chug it. LucidLogix can't make gaming laptops any skinnier, but the company's ""Lucid Virtu"" GPU virtualization technology can help with energy efficiency and battery life by powering discrete GPUs down to zero watts and switching the workload over to the CPU's integrated graphics when extra processing heft isn't necessary. Wait, isn't that what Nvidia's Optimus and AMD's Enduro graphics switching do already? Indeed it is, but those solutions are limited to GPUs offered by the respective companies and they only work if the graphics card you buy has the switching technology enabled. LucidLogix's Lucid Virtu is licensed directly by motherboard manufacturers and works with both AMD and Nvidia graphics. You can find a full list of compatible motherboards here. LucidLogix says dynamically switching the GPU workload also helps heat and noise levels down during less intensive tasks. The potential benefit to portable gaming is obvious. Unfortunately, only a handful of chipsets are supported right now and Virtu-enabled motherboards are desktop-only. Lucid Virtu has been around for over a year, but today the company announced the technology is now compatible with the OpenGL API. Earlier this week, the Khronos Group announced several major updates to OpenGL, including the release of the new OpenGL 4.3 and OpenGL ES 3.0 specifications, which bring a big boost to texture functionality, amongst other things. In the same press release, LucidLogix announced that the company's GPU switching technology is now available in select Fujitsu workstations and desktops, as well.",FoxNews
2012-06-11,"MacBook Pro Improvements: Ivy Bridge Processors, Nvidia GPUs, USB 3.0, Same Price","Just announced at WWDC, the 2012 MacBook Pro is said to be furnished in the same casing as last year's MacBook Pro but now it'll pack faster, more desirable guts. The new laptops get Intel's Ivy Bridge chips and Intel HD Graphics 4000 for improved performance as well as longer battery life and USB 3.0 (just like the ones available on the new MacBook Airs). The resolution will stay the same at 1440 x 900, and both the 13- and 15-inch systems will have optical drives, too. The 15-inch model will also have Nvidia's new Kepler GeForce GT650M graphics, and 1GB of memory, a switch from the 2011 15-inch MacBook Pro, which used AMD graphics. Both should also get up to 7 hours of battery life. The refreshed MacBook Pros will hit stores for the same prices as the previous models--$1,199 for a 13-incher and $1,799 for the 15-inch. So when can you pick up one of these bad boys? They ship as early as today.",FoxNews
2023-08-23,"2 UK teens part of hacking group that blackmailed ‘Grand Theft Auto’ maker, jury rules","A British jury ruled Wednesday that two teenagers were part of a hacking and blackmail campaign against technology companies including the maker of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" game series. Jurors at Southwark Crown Court in London said 18-year-old Arion Kurtaj committed 12 offenses including computer hacking, blackmail and fraud. A 17-year-old defendant who can’t be identified because of his age was convicted of fraud, blackmail and carrying out an unauthorized act to impair the operation of a computer. The 2-month trial was unusual: Psychiatrists assessed Kurtaj as unfit to stand trial, so the jury was asked to decide whether he had committed the alleged acts but not to deliver a verdict of guilty or not guilty. Prosecutors said the two teenagers were key players in a group known as Lapsus$ that in 2021 and 2022 hacked the computer systems of companies including communications provider BT, cellphone company EE, software company Nvidia and games-maker Rockstar Games, then threatened to release sensitive information unless they were paid millions in ransoms. One of the threats was to ""leak the stolen source code for the Grand Theft Auto sequel onto internet forums,"" the indictment said. It’s unclear whether ransoms were paid by any of the hacked firms. Both defendants will be sentenced later.",FoxNews
2012-08-31,"Lenovo IdeaPad U510: 15-inch Ultrabook Sports Nvidia GPU, Just $679","Lenovo's U Series Ultrabook line is growing in more ways than one. The newly announced IdeaPad U510 Ultrabook follows the same general aesthetic and build of Lenovo's U310 and U410, but adds a 15.6-inch screen, discrete Nvidia GeForce GT 625M graphics and a DVD drive. Here comes the best part: a starting price of $679. While those features give the Lenovo IdeaPad U510 an edge over the thin-and-light competition, they also cause the laptop to stride the fine line between an Ultrabook and a full-blown notebook. In fact, while the 0.82-inch thickness falls firmly (yet heavily) into Intel's Ultrabook definition, the IdeaPad U510's 4.8-pound weight is on the heavy side. The Lenovo IdeaPad U510 boots from sleep in just over a second. Under the hood, third-generation Intel Core processors and up to 8GB of RAM accompany the Nvidia GPU, with SSD cache drives and up to 1TB of HDD storage also available. Ports and features include a 720p webcam, Dolby Home Theater v4 and a a 2-in-1 card reader along with USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and HDMI connections. Even with all that un-Ultrabook-like firepower, Lenovo claims the IdeaPad U510 will carry a charge for up to six hours. Buyers will have to make a choice: are the Lenovo IdeaPad U510's 15.6-inch screen, discrete graphics and optical disc drive -- all rare features in an Ultrabook -- worth the extra size and weight?
